Young carers are children and teenagers who take on significant caring responsibilities for family members who are ill, disabled, or have mental health or addiction problems. This can include things like personal care, household chores, emotional support, and managing medication.

While there's some awareness of young carers, the ongoing challenges they face – like balancing school with caring duties, the emotional toll it takes, potential social isolation, and the long-term impact on their education and future opportunities – often aren't discussed enough in a way that leads to significant and lasting support systems. It's a really important issue because these young people are taking on huge responsibilities, and it can really affect their childhood and future.",,Candidate A,,,,,,,,,,,25,,15,20,,,,25,,,,15,,4,,5,3,,,,1,,,,2,,100,,20,Yes,,66,Yes,Likely,Strongly support,Strongly support,Somewhat support,Somewhat support,Indifferent,Strongly support,Strongly support,Strongly support,Strongly support,Strongly support,7,4,3,1,2,8,9,6,5,10,,,,,,,,"Increase climate finance to a level between what developed countries have agreed and what developing countries are asking for ($300 billion in grants, or 0.45% of GDP).",1,2,3,4,5,6,7,,,Yes,Scenario A,,,Somewhat support,A little,A right way,A right way,A wrong way,A wrong way,The best way,A right way,A right way,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,Yes,,I could sign a petition and spread ideas.,,,,"Yes, I would be more likely to vote for my party if it joined that coalition (or to vote for another party if only that other party joined the coalition).",1,2,3,High-income countries have a historical responsibility for the current situation in low-income countries.,,,,1,3,2,4,Indifferent,48000,14.998,14.998,16.076,1,,I want to skip this question.,Best possible10,,,,decrease,1,2,3,Strongly agree,My family and myself,,,,7.97,13.434,19.975,3,"No, I do not feel it was biased",No comments,,601,201,2.1,141675_a5ba9fb1,141675_c94f5b9e,141675_184b0070,141675,1403,,GB,5,1,0,1,2,2,1,1,1,low,0,0,0,1,0,Social issues,Tax system,Foreign policy,Climate policy,Economic issues,,Increase the Universal Credit for low-income households,Abolish the inheritance tax for estates under £2 million,-,Investment in renewables and nuclear to achieve zero-emissions electricity in 2030,"Healthcare plan: more appointments by utilising overtime employment, recruitment in mental care and dentistry coverage",,-,-,Deepen Brexit by removing or reforming EU-inherited laws,A ban on domestic flights for trips under three hours by train,A 4-day working week,,EN-GB,1744730794.539,16.0529999732971,1744730810.592,168.474999904633,1744730979.067,213.440999984741,1744731192.508,21.0510001182556,1744731213.559,125.059000015259,1744731338.618,33.9079999923706,1744731372.526,277.506000041962,1744731650.032,26.4670000076294,1744731676.499,113.416999816895,1744731789.916,64.1740000247955,1744731854.09,18.9620001316071,1744731873.051,40.0080001354218,1744731965.545,133.092000007629,1744732098.637,30.6569998264313,1744732129.294,52.4859998226166,1744731925.537,46.1410000324249,1744732175.435,,1,,,,,,2,1,,,,1,,,,1
