I'm freaked out about the likely loss of medicare and social security, as well as a recession due to Trump's ""policies"" which only empower the billionaires.  I worry about the fact that the current regime is trying to dumb down the population (by getting rid of the dept of education and by spreading propaganda) and that our health agencies are led by a moron who has ceased next year's flu and covid vaccines and that medical research has necessarily been suspended because of budget cuts.

In my opinion, a millionaire outside the US (or maybe the EU/ opec countries as well) lives far better than in the US.  In wealthy nations, where there is as vast a divide betwen the haves and the have-nots, I believe the tax should be on a higher threshhold, or at least on an income (not net-owrth) basis.  I'd suggest incomes over $00-$500k/yr in the US, or a net worth of over $20 million.

While I refuse to check the current status, with (hopefully, still) roughly $3million saved for retirement in a high-tax state in the US, I am worried it won't cover my taxes, lodging, food, and healthcare.  If I moved to a cheaper state (no way), I would feel pretty comfortable, I think.  See what I'm saying?

Studies show that child abuse and neglect (physical, emotional, or sexual) can cause many problems over time, some of which are:

Stunting development of the brain, which affects emotional and cognitive abilities, and in turn ability to learn
Problems with self-confidence or self-love
Trouble regulating emotions
Psychological issues (mood disorders (depression, anxiety), personality disorders, eating disorders, suicidal behavior)
Lack of trust and difficulty in having healthy relationships
Increased risk of becoming a perpetrator or victim of violence
Increased risk of alcohol and substance abuse
Lack of ability to control impulses (having risky/unsafe sex, financial instability)
Homelessness (victims of child abuse are 26 times more likely to experience homelessness at some point in their life)
An increased risk for diabetes, bronchitis, heart disease, stroke, liver disease, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and other chronic illnesses
An increased risk of being a victim of rape or sexual assault as an adult
An increased risk of intergenerational abuse (passing down abusive behaviors to their own children)
Impaired performance in the workplace
As you can see, the amount of issues that child abuse and neglect can cause are numerous and, without intervention and healing on an individual level, can lead to a poorer quality of life, emotionally, physically, psychologically, socially, and financially. Unfortunately there is little impetus on the part of lobbyists and those with money to wholly address the issue of child abuse and neglect; it would mean, depending on the efficacy of a long-term full-scale intervention, an eventual blow to the credit lending industry and to the healthcare, legal, prison, tobacco, and alcohol industries. It would also mean an eventual decrease in tax income for governments.

Through parental education and community effort, it may be possible to decrease the risk for ALL of the above issues in the world that are too commonly overlooked, along with working to prevent child abuse and neglect.",,Candidate B,,,,,,,,,,,,20,,20,,20,,,,30,,,10,,4,,5,,3,,,,1,,,2,100,,,Yes,64,Yes,Unlikely,Strongly support,Strongly support,Somewhat support,Strongly support,Somewhat support,Strongly support,Strongly support,Somewhat support,Somewhat support,Strongly support,,,,,,,Yes,,40,20,40,2,3,1,,,,,,,,,,,Scenario B,,,,Strongly support,,A little,A right way,A right way,An acceptable way,A right way,A right way,The best way,A right way,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,,I could sign a petition and spread ideas.,I could attend a demonstration.,,,"Yes, I would be more likely to vote for my party if it joined that coalition (or to vote for another party if only that other party joined the coalition).",3,2,1,,,Helping those in need is the right thing to do.
