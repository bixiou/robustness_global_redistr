I would want more accountability and assurance that the very vulnerable citizens of these countries would be helped in ways that would cause them to be more able to help themselves.  I.e. don’t give them a fish, teach them how to fish.";"Very informative survey";"NA";"Global warming is a global issue and should be addressed globally.

As much as we want to tackle global crisis, compulsory taxes on the rich isn't the way. They didn't steal the money, they made it leigitly, if they aren't giving the money willingly it's simply wickedness taking money they earned legitly for whatever reason. We can't solve one problem and create another. If the richest must be taxed, then all should be taxed, we are all benefitting for climate mission.

And the divide is not only politically but also along the values of the people being asked. For those living in the moment, climate change in 100 years matters little to them. On the other side there are those that look far into the future and want a global population that will never face want or deprivation. Both are valid in their own way, and its not of a small group of people to decide for the entire world.";"NA";"While not politically biased, I could not help but notice that it did have the income for taxation focused on the amount and not including or factoring the cost of living. Just because someone makes $120,000 or more does not mean that that is an affordable wage where they live.";"Very interesting survey I thought I was the only one who still cared about global warming and how it's gonna affect us in the future";"Quit trying to change my mind politically";"NA";"This has been a good survey.
