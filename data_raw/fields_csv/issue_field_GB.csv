This can include things like personal care, household chores, emotional support, and managing medication.\n \n While there's some awareness of young carers, the ongoing challenges they face – like balancing school with caring duties, the emotional toll it takes, potential social isolation, and the long-term impact on their education and future opportunities – often aren't discussed enough in a way that leads to significant and lasting support systems. It's a really important issue because these young people are taking on huge responsibilities, and it can really affect their childhood and future.";"NA";"NA";"I don't know.
