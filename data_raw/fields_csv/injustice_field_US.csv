So instead, leaders stoke division, manufacture conflict, and weaponize fear. The system rewards those who prolong problems, not those who solve them. This isn’t about left or right — it’s about power preserved through dysfunction.

It's not only unfair, but heartbreaking. We talk about equality across gender, race, and sexual orientation--but rarely do we talk about equality for people with intellectual disabilities.
