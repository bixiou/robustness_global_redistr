For instance, at the moment we are facing the very real possibility of war: normally I wouldn't want to put loads of my taxes into defence, but at the moment we have to. That money has to come from somewhere. Foreign aid has lost out. On the surface this seems wrong: however lots of that money was apparently going to Ukraine anyway, and a lot was going on housing for refugees. Tackling climate change is so important, and it's always the poor who suffer. A global war would make them suffer more. The whole reparation thing seems very off to me. I think that instead of reparation rich countries should be investing in education, healthcare, sanitation, renewable energy, in other countries. But we have a possible war. We're all into recycling, and have different bins for different waste. But apparently a lot of our waste intended for recycling plastic gets sent to poor countries, poisons their water table, and ends up in the sea.
