For instance, at the moment we are facing the very real possibility of war: normally I wouldn't want to put loads of my taxes into defence, but at the moment we have to. That money has to come from somewhere. Foreign aid has lost out. On the surface this seems wrong: however lots of that money was apparently going to Ukraine anyway, and a lot was going on housing for refugees. Tackling climate change is so important, and it's always the poor who suffer. A global war would make them suffer more. The whole reparation thing seems very off to me. I think that instead of reparation rich countries should be investing in education, healthcare, sanitation, renewable energy, in other countries. But we have a possible war. We're all into recycling, and have different bins for different waste. But apparently a lot of our waste intended for recycling plastic gets sent to poor countries, poisons their water table, and ends up in the sea.

This is a pressing concern, as it can lead to widespread disillusionment and disengagement from the political process.Â¹

There are several factors contributing to this issue, including the perception of politicians as dishonest or self-serving, the influence of money in politics, and the lack of transparency and accountability in government decision-making. Furthermore, the rise of social media has created an environment where misinformation and divisive rhetoric can spread quickly, eroding trust in institutions and fuelling public cynicism.

To address this issue, it's essential to focus on promoting transparency, accountability, and integrity in public life. This can involve strengthening parliamentary oversight, introducing reforms to party funding, and promoting a culture of openness and honesty within government and politics.

Some potential solutions that have been proposed include:

- *Strengthening parliamentary oversight*: Giving parliamentarians more power to hold the executive to account, through measures such as improved select committee powers and more effective use of parliamentary questions.
- *Reforming party funding*: Introducing stricter rules on party donations and improving transparency around lobbying and political finance.
- *Promoting a culture of integrity*: Encouraging a culture of openness, honesty, and accountability within government and politics, through measures such as improved whistleblower protection and stronger codes of conduct.

Ultimately, rebuilding trust in parliamentary democracy and promoting higher standards in public life will require a sustained effort from politicians, civil society, and the public alike.",,Candidate A,35,10,10,15,30,4,3,2,1,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,60,Yes,41,Yes,Likely,Strongly support,Somewhat support,Strongly support,Strongly support,Strongly support,Strongly support,Somewhat support,Somewhat support,Strongly support,Strongly support,,,,,,,No,,30,30,40,1,2,3,,,,,,,,,,,,Scenario A,Strongly support,,,,A little,The best way,The best way,An acceptable way,An acceptable way,The best way,The best way,An acceptable way,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,,,,,I could donate [amount_lottery: $100] to a strike fund.,"Yes, I would be more likely to vote for my party if it joined that coalition (or to vote for another party if only that other party joined the coalition).",3,2,1,High-income countries have a historical responsibility for the current situation in low-income countries.,,Helping those in need is the right thing to do.
