The incompetence of this government led by Pedro S√°nchez, disastrous for Spain due to its lies, narcissism, lust for power, and lack of democracy. Political corruption. The bias of some of the judiciary toward the PSOE. Unemployment, but not only unemployment, but also the lack of desire among many people to work, due in large part to the sloppy aid granted. The public's tension, fostered by politicians. The increase in taxes, which are not always well spent. Waste is wasted on non-essential and, at times, inappropriate things. Spain's enormous debt, which some politicians (especially Pedro S√°nchez and those who support him) seem unaware of, and from which I doubt we'll ever be able to escape. Outside our country, I am very concerned about the war and pre-war environment for which they seem to want to prepare us. The existing wars, not only in Europe, which affect those who live there in every way, but also those of us who are \'involved\' in them, morally and economically. Climate change, throughout the world, and the general lack of willingness to do our part, not only to reverse it, which I see as very difficult, but at least to try to stop it.

And destroying society, there is no social housing, no aid. I went to live in social housing and since I had no fixed income, they told me that when I retired. I went to ask for a rental when I retire because I live in my daughter's apartment, and at any moment she could kick me out on the street. She bought it deliberately for me, but there are times when she wants to sell it. Since I earn 620 euros, I have no rights since a shared home requires 300 euros for poor electricity and water, so I'm not entitled to anything either. While I was earning 700 euros as the minimum living wage, and before, 800 euros in Valencian income, now because I'm getting my pension back and they pay less, and with that, I have to pay all the expenses. I asked for a loan to fix up my house because, within reason, it's my house, and I pay 220 euros. Every month, 150 euros in community fees because we want to make improvements, and what I have left to pay for the electricity, water, and this, my contribution. I don't pay rent, but I have to pay all those expenses. With a bit of luck, I'll have 50 euros left over to eat for the whole month. If I get two extra payments, I'll use that to make a big purchase of pasta, rice, and food, so it won't perish. And with what I have left over every month, I try to eat some meat, frozen fish and little else, since we have to live in poverty for the rest of our lives.","issue"

On the one hand, the French must have an efficient health system and a higher salary, but we must also work more and plan for retirement later. Competition from countries like China, India, Korea, and Slavic European countries have a less expensive workforce. We need an effort plan. The 35-hour week has made the French believe that working less would be a fair distribution. We can see the damage. Only 1 in 2 French people go on vacation, and the other half don't get by. Every French person should pay a little tax, even a symbolic 50 Euros. by AN CMU RSA pensioners should offer hours of general interest that would allow them to make efforts, incomes should have a tax increase of 5% and by bracket, high incomes a little more but the measures must be taken for everyone, retirees too, distinguish those who pay rent and owners because they can be more contributors. This plan must be fair and explain and a majority could then be accepted and the immediate implementation. The ministries, the deputies, the senate should reduce their income by 10%; to show everyone that the efforts are accepted by everyone Lelys√©e too except in a crisis situation requiring a logical overcoming In short the acceptance of all because fairness of effort of everyone.

Injustice in the justice system: Wrongful convictions, police brutality, and unequal access to justice can erode trust and perpetuate harm.

Poverty and economic inequality: Limited access to resources, education, and healthcare can create cycles of poverty and disadvantage.

Environmental degradation: The disproportionate impact of environmental degradation on vulnerable populations can be seen as a grave injustice.

Income Taxes should be reduced and increased charges should be made on such things as Value Added / Sales Taxes - that way, those who spend money are paying a premium, on items, including travel & luxury goods...those who earn less money are ""saving"" money by not spending it, on things they cannot afford to own / creating their own debt.

Specifically, I hope that they will take effective measures to address the declining birthrate and aging population, increase investment in renewable energy and improve energy efficiency, correct inequality and achieve social fairness, and build an open, transparent, and trustworthy political system. I hope that they will listen sincerely to the voices of the people and promote politics based on dialogue and cooperation.","Through the questions so far, I was able to deepen my consideration from various angles of urgent global issues such as global warming countermeasures, poverty reduction, and wealth redistribution. \n To state my opinion briefly, international cooperation and fair burden sharing are essential to solving these issues, and innovative policies and system design are required for that. \n In a global climate countermeasure system, the idea of putting a price on greenhouse gas emissions and using the revenue for basic income has the potential to simultaneously advance environmental measures and poverty countermeasures, but I felt that careful consideration is needed, such as the burden on the people and the complexity of the system design. \n In terms of climate finance, financial assistance from developed countries to developing countries is important to ensure fairness in climate change countermeasures and support the sustainable development of developing countries. I think that the proportion of subsidies should be increased and larger-scale fund mobilization should be aimed for. \n In terms of international taxation of the wealthy, international taxation of billionaires and high-income earners suggests the possibility of becoming a new source of funds for poverty reduction and solving global issues. I felt that international consensus building and system design will be important. Although these policies may result in short-term economic burdens and public backlash, from a long-term perspective they have the potential to contribute to the realization of a more sustainable and fair society. I believe that what is important is to respect the circumstances and opinions of each country and to persistently pursue dialogue and cooperation toward solving global issues.","wish"

More focus tends to go to regulation or censorship, rather than the root problem of persuasive technology design.","This survey raised important and timely questions about global justice, climate change, and inequality.

"7514","Saudi Arabia","The greatest injustice of all, in my view, is the systemic denial of human dignity‚Äîwhere people are oppressed, exploited, or dehumanized based on arbitrary divisions like race, caste, class, gender, or religion. \n \nHistory is stained with such injustices: slavery, genocide, colonialism, caste oppression, gender apartheid, and economic exploitation. But perhaps the most profound injustice is when oppression is normalized‚Äîwhen entire societies are structured to perpetuate inequality, and those in power justify it as \'natural\' or \'deserved.\' \n \n Examples include: \n - **Slavery & Racial Oppression** ‚Äì The centuries-long subjugation of Black people, justified through pseudoscience and brute force. \n - **Caste Discrimination** - The brutal hierarchy that condemns millions to lifelong marginalization, as seen in caste systems. \n - **Gender-Based Violence** ‚Äì The global subjugation of women and LGBTQ+ people through laws, culture, and violence. \n - **Economic Exploitation** ‚Äì When workers are paid starvation wages while a tiny elite hoards wealth. \n - **War & Displacement** - When innocent civilians suffer for the ambitions of rulers, as in Gaza, Ukraine, Yemen, and countless other conflicts. \n \nThe deepest injustice is when those who suffer are silenced‚Äîwhen their pain is erased from history or dismissed as inevitable. True justice requires not just legal equality but the dismantling of systems that allow such oppression to persist.","What is the experience? What is the secret?

In contrast, someone earning SAR 15,000 monthly pays the same amount‚Äîan amount that is relatively insignificant for them but a major financial burden for the lower-income worker.\n Suggestion:\n I propose that instead of imposing a fixed dependent fee, the Kingdom considers implementing an income-based tax system, where all residents, including expatriates, contribute according to their income level.

"8517","USA","Los cambios economicos y sociales que se estan implementando debido a las nuevas medidas del gobierno, en especial el aspecto de imposicion de aranceles a la gran mayoria de los paises, la inmigracion, los despidos federales, cambios en el sistema educativo, tanto inicial como en universidades. Las relaciones internaciones para definir las politicas entre Ucrania y Rusia. La discusion con los paises europeos, la imposicion del idioma a los latinos en especial y en fin todo es preocupante, ya que son muchos cambios en tan poco tiempo que ha llevado a una gran mayoria estar a la expectativa a nivel general. Las fluctuaciones en el mercado de valores ha sido muy stresante para muchos inversionistas y grandes empresas a nivel internacional.

Y pues considero que la mayoria de la poblacion estamos consternados por la incertidumbre que se vive en el pais, unos mas afectados que otros, pero todos somos de alguna manera afectados, tal para muchos positivamente para igual para muchisimos mas negativamente.

El tiempo nos dira la realidad que iremos viviendo en el dia a dia . Dios mediante el bien comun sea PARA TODOS y que REINE LA PAZ Y LA ARMONIA EN EL MUNDO ENTERO: Asi sera, Amen amen amen.","Interesante la encuesta y controversial. Con posibles propuestas de impuestos a nivel global, en especial multimillonarios, empresas y a los ingresos individuales.

Seria muy positivo y es necesario combatir y frenar el cambio climatico por el bien de toda la humanidad. Ojala este Plan sobre el clima se pueda implementar a nivel global, seria la forma mas accesible de rescatar nuestro planeta tierra del mal camino al que vamos sino se enfrenta adecuadamente y en unio de todo el mundo.

En cuanto a donaciones  y prestamos a los paises mas desposeidos esta muy bien, pero hay un factor muy importante que es la CORRUPCION que afecta a la mayoria de entes gubernamentales, asociaciones de ayuda, rescate, salud y bueno todo lo que conlleva desarrollar y administrar todo lo recibido, en especial dinero que manejan personas que a la final desvian los recursos para los mas necesitados y causas comunes de salud, educacion, mejoras y eventos naturales que afectan en ocasiones,

Es comun escuchar como desvian los recursos y nadie hac nada al respeto y los que sacan a la luz publica los hechos de corrupcion no pueden lograr nada.

En especial lo dijo por mi pais VENEZUELA, que siendo un pais rico, el gobierno que lleva ya mas de 20 a√±os en el poder, lo ha llevado a una pobreza extreema, donde ir a un hospital hoy en dia implica llevar cada paciente los insumos que requiera para su condicion y de que corra con la suerte de que lo  atiendan. Y asi como eso la inflacion no se detiene y el adquirir alimentos hoy es un lujo para la gran mayoria.

Dar donaciones a un gobierno de esta condicion , lo mas probable es para disfrute de los corruptos.
Por eso deben implementar mecanismos condicionados que aseguren que los fondos recibidos sean realmente utilizados para ayudar a los mas necesitados, mejorar la salud, la educacion, la vivienda, hospitales que sean restaurados, ya que estan en pesimas condiciones.","concerns"

Many of them come to this nation looking to flee the nations they came from and the problems facing their nations and they bring their ways and customs here changing towns and cities not only in the make up of the people who lived there before them, but changing the customs and fabric of the towns and cities and in turn changing this nation. Its like an ecosystem and when you introduce new flora or fauna or even insects to a country or place they aren't from they begin to ruin the ecosystem and damage it for the worse and I think that is a big issue which our government and representatives from city to state to federal government is not addressing and it needs to be addressed.","I think the proposals are preposterous and its not any nations responsibility to help other nations. Americans died and have given so much to other nations. We work and then they tax us so we work for free in some cases (periods of time) to give that blood,sweat and tears to other nations peoples who did not sacrifice their lives in war (like WW2) and all the aid given and that's stolen and misused and other nations leaders stealing money and not helping their own citizens and enriching themselves. Colonization has brought western inventions and life saving things to nations who if the Europeans never showed up they would be living in a primitive state. Have you seen Africa or India? Imagine if the Europeans never set sail and showed up in these nations they would be living like bush people its 2025 and we see what they are living like today. There are people who just cant maintain or do the things western nations and people can do. Migration is a mistake and will ruin the fabric of nations they will destroy these nations and they will look like garbage its not because of a color of skin its because of culture and all cultures and people are not compatible.

"9673","USA","I think the greatest injustice of all is the widespread indifference towards people with intellectual disabilities. Too often, society assumes someone else will be there to take care of these individuals. They don't recognize the potential these individuals hold, the specialized needs they have, and that they have the right to live meaningful, independent lives like everyone else. This mindset leaves many of these individuals isolated, unsupported, and forgotten--and everyone talks about how terrible it can be, but no one steps up to change it. It's not only unfair, but heartbreaking. We talk about equality across gender, race, and sexual orientation--but rarely do we talk about equality for people with intellectual disabilities. Their rights, their voices, are often overlooked. Their potential is pushed aside and forgotten, society continues to treat them as an afterthought, while other equality wars rage on. These people are never seen, valued, and supported to the fullest.","It was only slightly biased, but it was. The thing is, there wasn't really space to say, ""yes, I agree with this idea in principle, but I think it would need some thoughtful adjustments to work properly."" For instance, taxing over $1 million seems like a good idea. However, farmers could go over that $1 million in assets, but that does not reflect their income properly. Most farmers couldn't afford that kind of tax cut, taking away from a sufficient and sustainable practice.","injustice"

The biggest injustice in America is that black people get billions of dollars in affirmative action money and special treatment by DEI initiatives, and advocate that white tax payers pay even more money directly to them in reperations, despite having institutional privilege by law in our college system and corporate hiring qoutas based on race, while gaslighting white Americans who fund the majority of this with our taxes and pretending that they are still oppressed in the year 2025.","I do not support America redistrubing wealth to other nations. I would be slightly more amicable to some level of wealth redistribution based on income that benefits all working class citizens, especially WHITE CAUCASIAN working class citizens. 

Black people ALREADY have affirmative action and DEI, they do not need additional handouts targeted specifically at them. They can get a job. Any potential future basic income has to be targeted an all working class citizens universally, as we automate the workforce ramping up productivity. 

I am in favor of domestic policy to address climate change, like investing in upgrading our energy grids and energy production to renewable sources of energy. And also policies like tax credits to companies who innovate in green energy. In am 100% opposed to White Americans resdributing wealth to non-white Americans, and im opposed to Americans as a whole redistributing wealth to non Americans.
