Climate Scheme: 

To meet the national climate target, a limited number of permits to emit greenhouse gases would be issued nationally. Polluting firms would be required to buy permits to cover their greenhouse gas emissions. Such a policy would make fossil fuel companies pay for their emissions and gradually raise the price of fossil fuels. Higher prices would encourage people and companies to use less fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Global Climate Scheme: 


In 2015, all countries agreed to contain global warming ""well below +2 °C"". To achieve this, there is a maximum amount of greenhouse gases we can emit globally. 


To meet the climate target, a limited number of permits to emit greenhouse gases would be issued globally. Polluting firms would be required to buy permits to cover their greenhouse gas emissions. Such a policy would make fossil fuel companies pay for their emissions and gradually raise the price of fossil fuels. Higher prices would encourage people and companies to use less fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions.


In accordance with the principle that each human has an equal right to pollute, the revenues generated by the sale of permits could finance a global basic income. Every adult would receive [amount_bi: $20][periodicity: per month], thereby lifting 600 million people who earn less than $2 a day out of extreme poverty.

The typical [national: American] would lose out financially [amount_lost: $105][periodicity: per month] (as he or she would face around [price_increase: 2]% in price increases, which is higher than the [amount_bi: $20][periodicity: per month] they would receive).


The policy could be implemented as soon as 100 countries agree to it. Countries that would refuse to take part in the policy could face sanctions (like tariffs) from the rest of the world and would be excluded from the basic income program.

There are two kinds of climate finance: grants (that is, donations) and loans. In 2022, $26 billion was provided as grants and the rest as loans, for a total of $116 billion. 

In 2009, developed countries agreed to mobilize $100 billion per year in climate finance by 2020. In 2024, they committed to raise this goal to $300 billion by 2035. None of the goals specify which share should be provided as grants.

Below are different positions on the amount of climate finance that should be provided in 2035, all expressed in grant-equivalent terms (that is, not counting loans):
-        $0: There should be no contributions from developed countries to climate action in developing countries.
-      $26 billion (0.04% of developed countries' GDP): The current amount, consistent with the old goal.
-    $100 billion (0.14% of GDP): The old goal, if all climate finance were provided as grants.
-    $300 billion (0.43% of GDP): The new goal, if all climate finance were provided as grants.
-    $600 billion (0.86% of GDP): The goal called for by India, a position shared by most developing countries.
- $1,000 billion (1.43% of GDP): The goal called for by Climate Action Network (a network of NGOs including Greenpeace, Oxfam, and WWF).

Scenario A: 
Most countries implement coordinated policies to limit global warming to +2°C and reduce inequality. The world greatly reduces greenhouse gas emissions and is on track to meet its climate target. Taxes on millionaires fund the installation of heat pumps, the thermal insulation of buildings, and improved public transportation. Yachts and private jets are phased out worldwide. Cars are all electric by 2045, and they are about the same price as internal combustion cars nowadays. By 2045, environmental regulations gradually double the price heating fuel or gas, air travel, and beef. As a result, people fly half as much, eat half as much meat, and use more public transportation in 2045 than they did in 2025. Despite higher prices for polluting goods, the overall purchasing power is preserved, thanks to a decrease in sales tax that reduces the prices of non-polluting goods.

Scenario B:
Since 2025, no additional policies are implemented to address climate change or inequality. People maintain the same lifestyles as in 2025. For example, most people continue to drive cars with internal combustion engines. Greenhouse gas emissions are stable. Global warming is expected to reach +3°C by 2100 and higher levels beyond that date. A warmer climate will cause more frequent and more severe droughts, heatwaves, wildfires, and coastal floodings.

Apart from the elements described, the two scenarios are the same (for example, in terms of unemployment or crime). 

Which scenario do you prefer for the future?","Which scenario do you prefer for the next 20 years?

Scenario A:
- No additional policies to address climate change or inequality. 
- Stable carbon emissions. Global warming expected to reach +3°C by 2100 and higher levels beyond 2100, which will cause more severe natural disasters.
- People maintain the same lifestyles as in 2025, such as driving gasoline cars.

Scenario B: 
- Worldwide policies to limit global warming to +2°C and reduce inequality. 
- Reduced global carbon emissions, in line with climate target. 
- Taxes on millionaires funding heat pumps, building insulation, and public transport. 
- All cars electric by 2045, priced like today's gasoline cars.


- Heating fuel, air travel, and beef prices gradually double. As a result, 50% less flying and meat consumption, and more public transport use. 
- Lower sales tax on non-polluting goods preserves overall purchasing power.

Apart from the elements described, the two scenarios are the same (for example, in terms of unemployment or crime). 

Which scenario do you prefer?","Consider two possible scenarios for the world for the next 20 years. 

Scenario A:
Since 2025, no additional policies are implemented to address climate change or inequality. People maintain the same lifestyles as in 2025. For example, most people continue to drive cars with internal combustion engines. Greenhouse gas emissions are stable. Global warming is expected to reach +3°C by 2100 and higher levels beyond that date. A warmer climate will cause more frequent and more severe droughts, heatwaves, wildfires, and coastal floodings.

Scenario B: 
Most countries implement coordinated policies to limit global warming to +2°C and reduce inequality. The world greatly reduces greenhouse gas emissions and is on track to meet its climate target. Taxes on millionaires fund the installation of heat pumps, the thermal insulation of buildings, and improved public transportation. Yachts and private jets are phased out worldwide. Cars are all electric by 2045, and they are about the same price as internal combustion cars nowadays. By 2045, environmental regulations gradually double the price of heating fuel or gas, air travel, and beef. As a result, people fly half as much, eat half as much meat, and use more public transportation in 2045 than they did in 2025. Despite higher prices for polluting goods, the overall purchasing power is preserved, thanks to a decrease in sales tax that reduces the prices of non-polluting goods.

Apart from the elements described, the two scenarios are the same (for example, in terms of unemployment or crime). 

Which scenario do you prefer for the future?","Currently, 2 billion people live in acute poverty, with less than [lcu_250: $250][periodicity: per month].
The Sustainable Development Goals, adopted by all countries in 2015, aim to alleviate poverty and give access to healthcare, education, drinking water, and sanitation for all by 2030. The world is not on track to meet these poverty reduction goals due to lack of funding.

Poverty reduction could be funded by a global tax on individual income above [lcu_120k: $120,000][periodicity_tax: per year]. 
The tax rate would be 15% for every [currency: dollar] over [lcu_120k: $120,000] of income after existing taxes. 
For example, a single person earning [lcu_130k: $130,000][periodicity_tax: per year] after taxes would pay [lcu_1500: $1,500] in additional taxes, or 15% of [lcu_10k: $10,000] = [lcu_130k: $130,000] - [lcu_120k: $120,000].

In this question, we let you choose your preferred parameters for a redistribution of income at the world level. 
If you prefer to skip this question, check the corresponding box at the bottom of the page.

The worldwide redistribution of income would take the form of additional policies, taxes, and transfers, on top of existing ones.
These policies would lower the income of the richest (the losers from the redistribution) and increase the income of the poorest (the winners). 

Below you will find a graph of the world distribution of after-tax income and three sliders that vary it. The current distribution is in red, and your custom one is in green. 
The first two sliders control the proportion of winners and the proportion of losers, among all humans. The third slider controls the degree of redistribution from the richest to the poorest. 
If you do not want new policies to reduce global inequality, you can set the third slider to zero. 

You need to move the sliders (by holding the mouse down on the little squares and moving to the side) to make the green curve evolve: the idea is to move the sliders until you get a green curve you are satisfied with.
