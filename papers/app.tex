\subsection{Country-specific features}\label{subsec:country_features}

In the survey, various features are tailored to country-specific characteristics. 
The workbook at \href{https://github.com/bixiou/robustness_global_redistr/raw/main/questionnaire/sources.xlsx}{github.com/bixiou/robustness\_global\_redistr/raw/main/questionnaire/sources.xlsx} contains all such features as well as their sources. 
In particular, it includes the following spreadsheets:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Quotas: target for each category based on frequencies among the adult population, as well as their sources (usually official statistical agencies) and the definition of regions. The coding of regions and urbanicity is done in Qualtrics based on zipcodes; with the zipcode correspondences exported in the repository folder \href{https://github.com/bixiou/robustness_global_redistr/raw/main/data_ext/zipcode_urbanity_region}{data\_ext/zipcode\_urbanity\_region} using code in \href{https://github.com/bixiou/robustness_global_redistr/raw/main/code_robustness/zipcodes}{data\_ext/code\_robustness/zipcodes}.
    \item Income, income\_raw: brackets used in the income question (\ref{q:income}), and associated sources and computations. I use household-level income Russia and the U.S.; equal-split income for Saudi Arabia; and equivalised income (i.e. standard of living, accounting for family composition) for other countries. Data sources are Eurostat for EU countries, Rosstat for Russia, WID for Saudia Arabia, Census Bureau for the U.S., and LIS for the other countries. 
    \item Policies, policies\_sources, policies\_leaning, policies\_party, policies\_leaning\_party: respectively the policies used in the conjoint experiment (Question~\ref{q:conjoint}), the source of each policy (i.e. the political program they come from), their political leaning (classified manually as 0 if the policy is consistent only with a left-wing program, 2 for a right-wing one, and 1 otherwise), the party that proposed each policy, and their political leaning based on the party that proposed each policy.
    \item Elections: results at the last election (used in Questions~\ref{q:voted}-\ref{q:vote}) including abstention share among citizens, as well as classifications of the parties: whether they are major (i.e. obtained more than 5\% of votes), and their political leaning (Left, Center-right or Right, Far right). 
    \item Figures, features: country-specific figures used in the questionnaire, as detailed below.
\end{itemize}

% Below, I give an overview of the different features, as well as the methodologies used to compute the figures characterizing the questionnaire's policies. 

Table \ref{tab:features} reports the figures used for each country for the National or Global Climate Scheme; the top income tax; and the revenue allocation of a wealth tax. Hereafter, I detail the methodologies used for these and other questions. 

\begin{table}[!h]
\caption[Country-specific features]{\hypertarget{tab_features}{Country-specific features of the questionnaire}.}\label{tab:features}
\makebox[\textwidth][c]{\input{../tables/features.tex}}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Climate Scheme.} 

In the Climate Schemes, I assume a carbon price of \$95/tCO$_\text{2}$, corresponding to the price in 2025 for an emissions trajectory compatible with a global warming peaking at +1.8\textdegree{}C before 2100.\footnote{More precisely, I use the price trajectory of the integrated assessment model IMAGE in the scenario SSP2-2.6, as given by the \href{https://secure.iiasa.ac.at/web-apps/ene/SspDb/download/iam_v2/SSP_IAM_V2_201811.csv.zip}{IIASA}.} 
After 2025, the decline in emissions is estimated to almost balance out the carbon price increase, in the sense that the share of carbon-intensive expenditures would be roughly constant over the thirty years following the initial phase-in, before plummeting as net-zero approaches \citep{fabre_global_2024}. In other words, the cost of climate schemes provided to the respondents reflect the direct monetary costs expected from a carbon price aligned with the Paris Agreement.  

In the National Climate Scheme, the average increase in expenditures is equal to the carbon price multiplied by the country's emissions per capita,\footnote{I use territorial CO$_\text{2}$ emissions from non-LULUCF by country from \cite{gutschow_country-resolved_2021}. I use the same source to estimate the emissions covered by the different scenarios in the International Climate Scheme.} and corresponds to the equal cash transfer each person would receive (Question~\ref{q:ncs_support}). Relative to the country's GDP per capita, this translates into the price increase reported in the Global Climate Scheme (GCS). To compute the amount lost, i.e. the net cost of the GCS for the average person in the country (Question~\ref{q:gcs_support}), I subtract the equal cash transfer from the increase in expenditures. 

In case of a strictly equal per adult allocation of carbon price revenue, the global basic income would amount to \$45 per month, corresponding to the world average emissions multiplied by the carbon price. However, to prevent highly emitting middle-income countries from losing financially, the GCS departs from the egalitarian allocation by offering them a waiver from the mutualization of revenue, thereby lowering cash transfers in other countries \citep{fabre_plan_2024}. 
When the country coverage is \textit{global}, as is implicitly the case in questionnaires for Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the U.S., this results in a global basic income of \$36 per month. 
In European countries and Japan, the cash transfer is even lower, at \$22 per month, since I implicitly assume a \textit{high} country coverage (cf. Figure \ref{fig:ics_maps}) that excludes countries with the greatest emissions per capita. 
As I conservatively use low figures for the transfer, the GCS question could somewhat underestimate the support in high-income countries for a global, egalitarian cap-and-trade. 

% In the International Climate Schemes, the question implicitly assumes that the costs would be the same as in the generic GCS question. This is credible if one assumes that each country would benefit for the same emissions rights in both cases. Indeed, as country coverage shrinks, two effects approximately balance out: the lower carbon price and the lower basic income, both of which result from lower emissions per capita within the climate coalition compared to the world average.

\paragraph{Global income distribution.}

To estimate the global income distribution, I use the distributions of disposable income by country in 2019 constructed by \cite{fisher-post_government_2023} (FPG). I inflate all generalized percentiles by real GDP growth observed between 2019 and 2024 (using IMF data), I factor in country-specific inflation until 2022 and convert values from LCU to 2022 PPP dollar (using FPG), and finally assume that all countries experienced the same inflation as in the U.S. in 2023 and 2024 (using IMF data). 

To aggregate country distributions, I compute the global cumulative density function and interpolate it at each thousandile. I obtain the global distribution of disposable income at purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2024. 

I use this distribution for the custom redistribution task, after converting back to LCU (Section~\ref{subsec:custom_redistr}, Question~\ref{q:custom_redistr}). I also use it to calibrate the top income tax schedules so that they raise an amount equivalent to the poverty gap (Section~\ref{subsec:radical}, Questions~\ref{q:top1_tax_support}-\ref{q:top3_tax_support}). % top~1\% tax collects 2.1\% of global disposable income, matching the \$250 per month poverty gap; while the top~3\% tax collects 5.1\% of global income, corresponding to the \$400 per month poverty gap. 
Then, I use country-level data to estimate the share of GDP collected as well as the share of the population affected by each tax in each country. 
Finally, I compute the poverty gaps and the tax revenue in every country in proportion to GDP, and aggregate them at the global level after converting national disposable income back to market exchange rates (using World Bank's PPP conversion factors for 2022). 
I find that the top~1\% tax collects 1.8\% of global nominal income, while the top~3\% tax collects 4.8\% of global nominal income. These amounts are higher than the respective poverty gaps: 1.3\% of global nominal income for a \$250 per month poverty line, and 3.2\% for a \$400 per month poverty line. 
While the cost of poverty reduction reduces relative to tax revenue once one accounts  for market exchange rates, closing the poverty gap actually requires extra revenue due to imperfect targeting and administrative costs \citep{sahoo_what_2025}. Therefore, the tax schedules' calibration are consistent with the poverty reduction objectives.

\paragraph{Wealth tax revenue.}

To estimate the revenue from a global tax on wealth above \$5 million at a rate of 2\% (Section~\ref{subsec:revenue_split}, Questions~\ref{q:revenue_split_few}-\ref{q:revenue_split_many}), I use the distribution of net wealth by country in current dollar for 2022 from the World Inequality Database. I assume that the taxable base is reduced by 30\% due to tax avoidance and asset depreciation. I report expected tax revenue as a share of countries' 2023 (from the World Bank). I also report the absolute revenue after converting them into LCU. 

\paragraph{NCQG.} 

The sources used for the New Collective Quantified goal of climate finance for 2035 (Section~\ref{subsec:debated}, Questions~\ref{q:ncqg_full}-\ref{q:ncqg}) are the following: \cite{unfccc_new_2024} states the goal itself, \cite{oecd_climate_2024} provides figures on past achievements, \cite{earth_negotiations_bulletin_daily_2024} reports the positions of India and other countries, \cite{climate_action_network_climate_2024,demand_climate_justice_engo-demand_2025} those of NGOs. Note that the question wordings do not mention the gap between climate finance needs and the official goal identified in official reports \citep{oecd_bridging_2024,songwe_raising_2024}, nor that existing plans by Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) to ramp up climate finance would almost achieve most of the new goal \citep{mdbs_joint_2024}.\footnote{According to the  \cite{oecd_climate_2024}, MDBs contributed \$81 to climate finance in 2022 (both directly through finance provision and indirectly through mobilization of the private sector), with 71\% (or \$58 billion) attributable to developed countries. Before the NCQG was agreed at COP29, they jointly stated that they will contribute an estimated \$185 billion in 2030 (including \$65 billion from the private sector). Assuming that this increase of \$104 billion is replicated in the period 2030-2035, MDBs would contribute \$289 billion in 2035, including \$205 attributable to developed countries, that is \$147 billion more than in 2022. As (multilateral plus unilateral) developed countries' climate finance totaled \$116 billion in 2024, adding up the \$147 billion expected in their multilateral finance would achieve three-quarter of the required increase, at \$263 billion.}

To express the NCQG as a share of developed countries' GDP, I use 2024 data from the World Bank on nominal GDP in high-income countries. This figure ---of \$70 trillion--- is conservative, since it does not account for growth or inflation until 2035.
% Actually I accounted for growth, but used a weird source underestimating developed countries' GDP:
% GDP advanced: 61.35T / others: 43.44 in 2023: IMF (https://www.statista.com/statistics/256328/gross-domestic-product-gdp-of-selected-global-regions/); Growth per year by 2035 advanced: 1.59% / all: 2.7% (https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/special-reports/look-forward/emerging-markets-a-decisive-decade) => GDP advanced 2035: 61.35*1.0159^12=74.1T / others: world-74=(61.35+43.44)*1.027^12=144-74=70T, i.e. 51% in advanced. NB: the difference between advanced and developed is South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan (Saudi Arabia and Slovenia are classified consistently using both definitions). I subtract 3.1 (South Korea, cf. spglobal above) + 0.9 (Taiwan, current GDP + 20%) + 0.6 (Singapore, current GDP + 20%) = 4.6T to obtain 69.5T for "developed" countries' nominal GDP in 2035.

\section{The determination of a custom redistribution}\label{app:algo}

In Question~\ref{q:custom_redistr}, respondents are asked for their preferred redistribution of the world's post-tax income. This custom redistribution is determined by modifying the current distribution using the respondent's three input parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textit{proportion of winners}, i.e. the share of people (at the bottom of the distribution) advantaged by the custom redistribution;
    \item The \textit{proportion of losers}, i.e. the share of people (at the top) disadvantaged by the redistribution;
    \item The \textit{degree of redistribution}, ranging from 0/10 (no redistribution) to 10/10 (maximal redistribution).
\end{itemize}

The determination of the custom distribution given these parameters relies on the algorithm \textit{Dis/adv} introduced by \cite{fabre_french_2022}. In that paper, \cite{fabre_french_2022} surveyed two representative samples of French respondents. The first survey uncovered the median preferred parameters for a national income redistribution.\footnote{The median preferred proportions of winners and losers were 50\% and 10\%, respectively. The median preferred degree of redistribution was defined indirectly, using the median preferred demogrant: \euro{}800/month. The resulting redistribution entailed 12\% of GDP redistributed from the top 10\% to the bottom 50\%.} The second survey showed that 52\% supported the income redistribution defined using these parameters while only 26\% opposed it. Furthermore, a majority among the French respondents who expressed an opinion agreed that it is a good idea to ``determine the citizens' preferred tax schedule from a survey and then submit the proposal that would emerge from the survey to a referendum.'' Therefore, the algorithm \textit{Dis/adv} applied to median preferred parameters has been validated both through the support for the resulting redistribution and through the support for such democratic method of preference aggregation to determine an income redistribution. Nonetheless, the algorithm \textit{Dis/adv} is just a first attempt to adjust the tax schedule by aggregating citizens' preferences, and more appropriate methods may be proposed. Although \cite{fabre_french_2022} finds that the algorithm \textit{Dis/adv} fares better than another algorithm tested, the method still suffers from some limitations. In particular, the current method is difficult to understand for the users, and it only allows for redistribution from the rich to the poor (it would thus be inappropriate if the level of inequality were considered too low). Below, I describe the algorithm \textit{Dis/adv}, available for use at \href{https://adrien-fabre.com/custom_global_redistr.html}{bit.ly/custom\_redistr}, and implemented in the R function \verb|compute_custom_redistr| on \href{https://github.com/bixiou/robustness_global_redistr/raw/main/code_robustness/2_prepare.R}{github.com/bixiou/robustness\_global\_redistr/raw/main/code\_robustness/2\_prepare.R}.

\paragraph{Algorithm Dis/Adv} 

It is worth reminding that on a range of income (concerning people that are neither winner nor loser from the reform), both current and custom distributions coincide. The algorithm proceeds as follows:

\begin{figure}[b!]
  \caption[Algorithm for the custom redistribution]{Algorithm for the custom redistribution, with parameters \textit{winners}: 60\%, \textit{losers}: 20\%, \textit{degree}: 4/10.} \label{fig:algo} 
  \begin{subfigure}{.49\textwidth}

  \begin{subfigure}{.49\textwidth}
    \caption[]{Steps 3 and 4.}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/questionnaire/algo_3-4_full.PNG}
  \end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Define the \textit{extreme distribution} as the current distribution bounded by the income thresholds of winners and losers. In other words, draw two horizontal lines at each end of the distribution, by setting the incomes of winners to the income of the richest winner, and those of losers to income of the poorest loser.
    \item Compute what can be redistributed on either side as the area between the extreme and current distributions: what can be given to winners on the left side ($L$) or taken on the right side ($R$). If and only if what can be given is lower than what can be taken ($L < R$, as in Figure \ref{fig:algo}), the left side is binding, and it determines the \textit{amount transferred} from the rich to the poor: $\min\{L;\,R\} \cdot degree$.
    \item On the binding side, define the custom distribution as a linear mixture between the current and extreme distributions, with the mixture parameter set by the \textit{degree of redistribution}. In other words, starting from the current distribution, narrow the gap with the extreme distribution by a factor \textit{degree}.
    \item Adjust the non-binding side by narrowing the gap with the extreme distribution, using the unique mixture parameter that preserves aggregate income (so that the amount transferred is the same on both sides).\footnote{While we do not account for behavioral responses, one can adjust the algorithm to account for them. It suffices define a post-reform aggregate income, which can be lower than the pre-reform one if the reform disincentivizes economic activity.}
    \item ~[Optional step, used in the survey.] To increase the demogrant (i.e. the lowest income) and make the reform more progressive on the left side, try to replace the left side by a straight line. In other words, find the demogrant and the straight line between the demogrant and the threshold of winners that respects the amount transferred. If this straight line crosses the current distribution or if it implies a regressive redistribution (in that some income would increase less than a higher income), abandon the straight line and keep the custom redistribution as is.
\end{enumerate}

Once the custom redistribution has been determined, it is straightforward to compute the additional tax schedule required to attain it.\footnote{For a sophisticated calculation of the required tax schedule, which allows for behavioral responses and a gradual implementation, see Appendix IX of \cite{fabre_french_2022}.} Figure \ref{fig:tax_radical_redistr} presents the tax schedule required to attain the average custom redistribution (weighted over all respondents). Figure \ref{fig:tax_radical_redistr} shows that (on the losers' side) this redistribution can ba approximated by additional marginal tax rates of 7\% above \$25,000/per year, and 16\% above \$40,000. Figure \ref{fig:tax_radical_redistr} also compares this tax schedule with those associated with the radical income redistribution tested in Questions \ref{q:top1_tax_support}-\ref{q:top3_tax_support}: While the average custom redistribution features a much larger tax base than the radical tax targeting the top 3\% (as it taxes the top 28\%), its top tax rate is three times lower, so that the two redistributions entail similar transfers from the rich to the poor, at 5.1\% of the world's income. % it features higher tax rates than the radical tax on the top 1\%, but 
% TODO explain how the top income is determined
