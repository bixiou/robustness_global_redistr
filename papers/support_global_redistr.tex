\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}% AER

The development gap between the Global North and the Global South is central in 
international relations. %, with the question of North-to-South transfers of resources and power at the forefront. 
The issue of North-to-South transfers of resources and power 
permeates negotiations in many areas, including debt restructuring, development assistance, tax cooperation, UN reform, and climate finance.\footnote{The (re)distribution of resources between countries is debated in different official fora, such as the G20, the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project, the Conference on Financing for Development, the International Maritime Organization, the Global Solidarity Levies Taskforce, the UN Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation, and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Appendix~\ref{subsec:plausible_policies_sources} provides references on official initiatives for global redistribution.} 
In all international fora, Global South countries seek % North-to-South transfers of resources and power
a more equal world order. Indeed, redirecting just 1\% of high-income countries' output to low-income countries (LICs) would mechanically double their national income.\footnote{The GDP per capita of high-income countries (HICs) is \href{https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD?contextual=default&end=2024&locations=EU-ZG-XD-XM-1W-IN-US-CD-BI-LU-CN&start=2024&view=bar}{28 times} greater than that of low-income countries (LICs) at Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) and \href{https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?end=2024&locations=EU-ZG-XD-XM-1W-IN-US-CD-BI-LU-CN&start=2024&view=bar}{68 times} greater in nominal terms, from World Bank 2024 data. Given that 625 million people live in one of the 25 low-income countries %defined by GDP per capita at Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) below \$1,135 per year, 
and 1.42 billion people in high-income countries, %with a GDP per capita of over \$13,935.().
1\% of HICs' GDP corresponds to 60\% of LICs' GDP using PPP values and 153\% using nominal data.
}

Public attitudes in high-income countries (HICs) are key to understanding whether globally redistributive policies would be politically feasible. 
Recent large-scale surveys reveal worldwide 
support for a globally coordinated tax on billionaires \citep{cappelen_majority_2025}, % revision? remove from here as there is no international transfers in cappelen_majority_2025?
a democratic world government for global issues \citep{ghassim_who_2024}, climate action at the global (rather than national) level \citep{dechezlepretre_fighting_2025}, %increased foreign aid, 
as well as globally redistributive climate or tax policies \citep{fabre_majority_2025}. 
% Surveying the public in 40 countries, \cite{cappelen_majority_2025} document overwhelming support for a globally coordinated tax on billionaires, 

Despite strong stated support even in HICs, international redistribution is rarely discussed in public debates, let alone advocated % championed? embraced % 
by policymakers. % seldom embraced by policymakers or even activists in HICs. 
\cite{fabre_majority_2025} conduct survey experiments in the U.S. and four Western European countries to understand this mismatch, focusing on a ``Global Climate Scheme'' (GCS) costly to these countries. The authors reject hypotheses that support for the GCS might be overstated: they find no social desirability bias in a list experiment, 6 out of 10 respondents prefer a political program that includes the GCS over one that does not, and most respondents are willing to sign a petition in favor of the GCS. % or may vanish in case of a negative media cam*-+*paign. 
% TODO: more figures pro global redistr before instead of giving so prominently a counterargument here
While the authors find support reduced by 11 percentage points (p.p.) following a (fictitious) negative media campaign --- an effect size similar to the actual decrease in support for the ``Green New Deal'' after it was publicly debated \citep{gustafson_development_2019} --- a campaign effect of this magnitude would not generate majority opposition to policies favored by three-quarters of the population, such as a globally redistributive wealth tax. Therefore, \cite{fabre_majority_2025} conclude that support for global redistribution is genuine, %and their tests cannot fully explain why this topic is not more prominent in public debates. 
and another hypothesis is needed to explain the lack of prominence of this issue. A promising candidate is ``pluralistic ignorance'': the underestimation of public support. Indeed, pluralistic ignorance has been documented regarding %costly 
climate action \citep{andre_misperceived_2024,andre_globally_2024,mildenberger_beliefs_2019}, the billionaire tax \citep{cappelen_majority_2025}, and the GCS \citep{fabre_majority_2025}. 
Nevertheless, pluralistic ignorance has not prevented climate policies or a national wealth tax from entering public debates, suggesting that other mechanisms may be at play concerning global redistribution.

In this paper, I conduct a pre-registered large-scale survey to examine whether global redistribution policies are robustly accepted and to investigate the reasons for their lack of prominence. I test several hypotheses. Surveying eleven HICs, I test whether international policies are accepted by majorities in countries considered conservative and not yet surveyed on this topic, such as Japan, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Switzerland. Recognizing that some key countries would likely not participate if these policies were implemented, I test how acceptance is affected when a climate scheme or a wealth tax is international but not truly global. I also test for pluralistic ignorance. I analyze the salience of global redistribution, and whether it is a vote-determining issue. I test for ``warm glow'', whereby people delude themselves into supporting hypothetical policies in order to ease their conscience, notably by testing whether the support is only claimed for as long as the policies are deemed unlikely. Finally, I explore a variety of international policies, ranging from the plausible to the radical. % TODO: rewrite to problematize, see e.g. grant proposal
% Hypotheses: warm glow, salience, pluralistic ignorance, non-global or new countries

Throughout the paper, I make a distinction between \textit{support} and \textit{acceptance}. I use the term \textit{support} to refer to the absolute share of \textit{Somewhat} or \textit{Strong support} on Likert scales, and \textit{acceptance} to refer to relative support --- specifically, the support share among non-\textit{Indifferent} responses. Although binary (\textit{Yes}/\textit{No}) questions are typically worded in terms of ``support'', I generally report their results using the term \textit{acceptance}. This approach avoids mistaking passive consent for active support among respondents who could not choose a neutral option. 
% Throughout the paper, I use the term \textit{acceptance} to refer to positive responses to survey items phrased in terms of support. This better captures the idea of passive consent rather than active demand.
% TODO!! support or acceptance? =>
% Demand: active mobilization
% Preference: the policy is favored to alternatives (by a majority)
% Support: absolute support
% Acceptance: relative (= conditional) support. Also used for binary questions as acceptance would be closest in terms of result adding a neutral option. => I could also use support, sticking to question wording (pro: consistent with figures)
% Tolerance/Assent: non-opposition (support + indifference)
% Net support: support minus opposition
% => I stick to the above terminology for specific questions; when I talk about overall survey results I use acceptance rather than support

% TODO relative support => acceptance?
The results confirm earlier studies: I find majority acceptance in every country surveyed for almost all globally redistributive policies tested. Policies currently discussed in international negotiations are accepted by large majorities. The most supported policy is the 2\% tax on billionaire wealth proposed by \cite{zucman_blueprint_2024}, with 81\% acceptance in the pooled sample. Proposals such as debt relief for vulnerable countries, developed countries contributing 0.7\% of their GDP in foreign aid, an expansion of the UN Security Council, or the Bridgetown initiative (expanding sustainable investments at low interests rates in LICs) all garner at least 70\% acceptance overall. 

Radical proposals are also widely accepted. Majorities in every country agree that ``governments should actively cooperate to have all countries converge in terms of GDP per capita by the end of the century'', and that globally coordinated climate policies are preferable to the status quo, even if they entail completely electrifying cars by 2045 and doubling the prices of heating fuel, flights, and red meat. Overall, I find 64\% acceptance for a progressive income tax that would collect 5\% of world income from the global top~3\% to finance poverty reduction in the Global South, with tax rates ranging from 15\% above \$80,000 per year to 45\% above \$1 million. Relatedly, in an interactive task where respondents design their preferred global income redistribution, nearly half choose a redistribution that would make them poorer (versus less than 10\% choosing one that would make them richer). The average custom redistribution entails over 5\% of world income in transfers from the rich to the poor. 

Before respondents could infer the survey's topic, they had to complete a budget allocation task and a conjoint experiment. When asked to allocate the revenue from a %hypothetical 
global wealth tax among five spending items, 87\% of respondents allocate a positive amount to the global item (public services in LICs). This item receives an average preferred share of 17.5\% of the revenue, slightly below an equal split of 20\%. %This indicates that most people attach to sustainable development abroad a priority lower than for the average issue, but non-zero. 
This indicates that most people prioritize sustainable development abroad less than the average issue, but still consider it worthwhile. 

%  TODO country ranking?
While policies to address global inequality are widely accepted, they have low salience. Indeed, this topic is rarely mentioned in open-ended fields at the beginning of the survey, where respondents were asked to write about various considerations. Respondents' top concern is the cost of living, and their most frequent wish is for greater purchasing power. While inequality is most often regarded as the greatest injustice ---with some inconclusive indications that these responses relate to inequality at the global level--- global inequality almost never appears among issues respondents consider important but neglected in public debate. 

Despite its low salience, global redistribution may be a vote-determining issue, as %indicated by % revision
the conjoint experiment suggests. 
In this task, respondents express their preference between two political programs, each composed of policies randomly selected from those prominently debated in their country. When a program includes a \textit{global tax on millionaires with 30\% of the revenue funding LICs}, the likelihood of that program being preferred increases by 4~p.p., while \textit{cutting development aid} reduces it by 4~p.p.  A direct question confirms that some voters might change their vote intention if a candidate campaigned on sustainable development: 36\% of respondents report they would be more likely (versus 17\% less likely) to vote for a party if it participated in a global movement for climate action, taxes on millionaires, and poverty reduction in LICs. In a related question, 68\% of respondents (and 52\% of the 561 millionaires who responded) state they could actively participate in such a movement (either by signing a petition, attending a demonstration, going on strike, or donating to a strike fund). 

What if a sustainable development policy is international but not global? Acceptance decreases only slightly. In the case of a wealth tax with 30\% of revenue financing LICs, acceptance is reduced from 74\% to 68\% when the policy is implemented only by some countries (e.g. the EU, the UK, and Brazil) rather than all countries. Likewise, acceptance of an International Climate Scheme (ICS), defined as a cap-and-trade with equal per capita allocation of emissions rights, decreases from 68\% to 65\% when participating countries shrink from a group covering 72\% of world emissions to one covering 33\% of emissions.

I identify pluralistic ignorance through an incentivized question that asks respondents for their belief regarding support for the Global (version of the) Climate Scheme, either among their compatriots or in the U.S. In Japan and in European countries, there is majority support for the GCS, yet most people believe there is not. Overall, the median respondent underestimates support in their own country by 16~p.p. and non-American respondents underestimate support in the U.S. by 22~p.p. Pluralistic ignorance may be an important reason why global solidarity solutions are neglected.

To test whether support might drop if the prospect of global policies materializes (a form of \textit{warm glow}), I manipulate the belief that large international transfers are likely in the next fifteen years. More specifically, I inform a random half of the respondents that ``countries have agreed to demonstrate some
degree of solidarity in addressing global challenges'', providing diverse examples including the % recent % revision
adoption of a shipping levy at the International Maritime Organization that should partly finance LICs, developed countries' commitments to finance climate action in developing countries, and the study % consideration? exploration?
by the G20 of a coordinated % common % revision
tax on billionaires. The information treatment increases the belief that transfers are likely by 7~p.p. from a baseline of 33\%, and it %. If anything, it 
also \textit{increases} the share of global policies supported by 1~p.p. %, though this effect is not statistically significant ($p$-value = .12). 
An IV estimation shows that the share of policies supported causally increases by 18~p.p. when people believe that international transfers are likely, %; however,   the effect is not significant ($p$ = .11). 
% In an IV specification, the share of policies supported rises by 14~p.p. ($p$ = 0.11) when individuals believe that international transfers are likely%
% Furthermore, the IV estimate is consistent with the non-causal %effect estimated 
% by OLS estimate of 15~p.p. 
consistent with the non-causal effect estimated by OLS. 
In other words, I find no evidence of \textit{warm glow}. On the contrary, the effect tends to go in the opposite direction compared to the \textit{warm glow} hypothesis: if people believed that a global policy were likely, they would be more likely to support it (there is suggestive evidence of %which can be interpreted as
 a \textit{status quo} bias). 

Finally, I test respondents' broad values to verify their consistency with global redistribution. The majority of respondents agree that ``helping countries in need in the right thing to do''. However, only a minority is convinced that it is in HICs' long-term interest to do so, or that it is their historical responsibility. Similarly, there is no majority support for reparations for colonization and slavery in the pooled sample. These results suggest that support for global solidarity is driven by a sense of empathy and duty rather than guilt or interest. % TODO lire Cappelen 2025: pluralistic ignorance

Following the works of \cite{enke_moral_2020,cappelen_universalism_2025}, it is interesting to measure the degree of universalism. % TODO!! elaborate, read
I use a new question to measure universalism, asking respondents which group they advocate for when they vote. 45\% choose a universalist response (either ``Humans'' or ``Sentient beings (humans and animals)''), while 32\% opt for their fellow citizens. Using a variance decomposition, I find that universalism is a stronger predictor of policy attitudes than sociodemographic variables such as income, country or even vote choice, echoing the results of \cite{enke_universalism_2024}. % TODO for them it's not better than vote
Consistent with the cross-national differences observed in other measures, the share of universalists is lowest in Japan. % and the U.S. %, and highest in Saudi Arabia. 
Meanwhile, there is a majority of universalists in Europe, Saudi Arabia, and among left-wing voters. 
% Results: plausible as well as large changes accepted, low salience, lower-than-average but non-zero priority, vote-dermining (conjoint+movement), no warm glow, pluralistic ignorance, only slight decrease if non-global, duty main reason + linked to universalism

By studying in depth the support for global policies, this paper departs from the usual  %introduces a shift in the 
methodological approach of attitudinal surveys. In general, academic surveys focus on estimating effect sizes of some treatment on political attitudes, or identifying the socio-demographic factors and the beliefs that correlate with attitudes (e.g. \citealp{kuziemko_how_2015,douenne_yellow_2022,alesina_intergenerational_2018}). The magnitude of support for a given proposal is often deemed unsuitable for satisfactory estimation, %as problematic to estimate satisfactorily. %
% It is often argued that 
because such attitudes are viewed as weakly held, inconsistent, or unstable. 
The measure of support is usually left to non-academic pollsters, who rarely apply all academic best practices: transparency, representative sampling, neutral and precise question wording, comparison with existing literature, and the use of multiple questions and complementary methods to correctly interpret the results. Although estimating the extent of support is challenging, this question seems too important not to be addressed using scientific methods. 
Furthermore, \cite{ansolabehere_strength_2008} refute common perceptions regarding policy attitudes, showing that they are as stable and %this assess once measurement error has been reduced through the use of multiple measures,
nearly as predictive of vote choice as party identification.  
% Furthermore, %absent large scale measurements of public opinion like referenda, 
% representative surveys remain the best method to assess support or opposition to given policies. 
In this paper, I examine support for various policies, approach the question from diverse angles, and run a battery of pre-registered tests to check % assess, ascertain, confirm, corroborate, validate
the reliability of stated support estimates.

\paragraph{Related literature.} 
Previous cross-country surveys consistently find strong public support for globally redistributive policies \citep{cappelen_majority_2025,fabre_majority_2025} or global democratic governance \citep{ghassim_who_2024}. % re-cite universalism?

Although it focuses on multilateral policies, the paper relates to the literature on attitudes toward foreign aid. \cite{kaufmann_foreign_2019} and \cite{fabre_majority_2025} find, that despite an important overestimation of the amount of aid, desired aid is larger than perceived aid in most countries. \cite{hudson_mile_2012} provide a critical review of the literature and show that the strong support for poverty alleviation largely stems from intrinsic altruism, in line with Eurobarometer data \citep{cho_ideology_2024}. 

\cite{nair_misperceptions_2018} finds that US-Americans underestimate their rank by 27 percentiles on average and overestimate the global median income by a factor 10, lowering their support for foreign aid. Likewise, \cite{fehr_your_2022} finds that 9 out of 10 Germans want global redistribution, even though respondents underestimate their relative position in the global income distribution by an average of 15 percentiles. %, although they do not misperceive their rank in the national distribution on average. 

Finally, the paper contributes to strands of literature which analyzes dispositions towards free-riding on climate action and how support for climate agreements depends on their country coverage. 
Using conjoint analyses in Western countries, 
\cite{bechtel_mass_2013} and % AER revision
\cite{beiser-mcgrath_could_2019} show that a climate agreement with larger country coverage are %15 p.p. 
more likely to be preferred. In Germany and the U.S., \cite{gampfer_obtaining_2014} also find stronger support for funding climate action in low-income countries when cost is shared with other countries. Nevertheless, surveys consistently show that people support unilateral climate action in their country, even in the absence of such action in other countries \citep{bernauer_how_2015,mcgrath_how_2017,beiser-mcgrath_commitment_2019%,sivonen_attitudes_2022
}. \cite{aklin_prisoners_2020} show that the empirical evidence for free-riding is not compelling, and that climate inaction can be equally well explained by distributive conflicts. Still, survey evidence indicates some degree of conditional cooperation: support for domestic climate action increases if other countries join forces \citep{carlsson_importance_2025}.

% By employing a theoretical model and examining correlations between lobbying and actual aid (controling for desired aid), they argue that the gap between actual and desired aid stems from the political influence of the rich who defend their vested interests. \cite{gilens_political_2001} shows that even Americans with high political knowledge misperceive actual aid, and finds that 17\% fewer of them want to cut aid when we provide them specific information about the amount of aid. % same for Hurst et al

\section{Data and Design\label{sec:data}}

\paragraph{Samples.}
I conducted an original survey of 12,001 respondents representative of the adult population in eleven high-income countries (see Figure \ref{fig:country_coverage}). The countries were chosen to span the diversity of high-income countries and the sample sizes to be commensurate with each country's population size.\footnote{The sample sizes are as follows: U.S.: 3,000; Japan: 2,000; Russia: 1,001; Saudi Arabia: 1,000; Europe: 5,000, split in proportion to the countries' adult population sizes (except for Switzerland), i.e. France: 798; Germany: 1,048; Italy: 756; Spain: 603; Poland: 500; Switzerland: 469. The maximum margins of error (at the 5\% threshold) for country samples range from $\pm$1.8 p.p. in the U.S. to $\pm$4.5 p.p. in Switzerland, with an intermediate value of $\pm$3.1 p.p. in Saudi Arabia. } 
The survey was fielded online in 2025 using the companies \textit{Yandex} (for Russia), \textit{Kantar} (for Saudi Arabia), and \textit{Bilendi} (for the other countries).\footnote{For all countries except Russia, responses were collected between April 15 and July 3, 2025. For Russia, responses were collected between September 19 and October 9, 2025. Each complete response was rewarded with approximately \euro{}3 in gift points.} 

In Russia, I could not administer the same questionnaire as in the other countries.\footnote{To the best of my knowledge, \cite{toews_learning_2025} were the first to manage surveying the Russian public on climate attitudes.} I had to curtail it for two reasons. First, I could not use the platform \textit{Qualtrics}, which prevented me from using certain question formats (such as constant sum scales) or embedding Javascript (used to design the interactive question). Second, I had to cut or reword some questions due to preventive censorship by the survey company. In the other countries, the questionnaires are almost identical, though the figures in the questions are adapted to the country-specific context (e.g. respondents are informed about the cost of the Global Climate Scheme to the average person in their country). Appendix \ref{subsec:country_features} lists the unique features of the questionnaire in each country.

    \makebox[\textwidth][c]{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/maps_participation/country_coverage_curtailed.png}} 
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Representativeness.}\label{par:representativeness}
The samples are stratified to be representative of the country's adult population based on the following quota variables (with some exceptions\footnote{In the U.S., I also use race (4 categories) as a quota variable. In Saudi Arabia, I do not use urbanicity, but I use citizenship (Saudi vs. non-Saudi). In Russia, I do not use region nor urbanicity.}): 
gender, age (5 brackets), income (4), diploma (3), region (2 to 5), and urbanicity (2 to 3). Tables \ref{tab:representativeness_0}-\ref{tab:representativeness_3} in Appendix \ref{app:representativeness} show that the samples closely match the actual population frequencies along these dimensions, except for Russia and Saudi Arabia, where individuals without a high school diploma are somewhat underrepresented, as well as low-income individuals in Russia and non-Saudis in Saudi Arabia. All results are reweighted to be fully representative of the population along the quotas, with weights trimmed between 0.25 and 4. Results aggregated at the global or European levels weigh each country in proportion to its adult population size. Descriptive results on a random branch use weights that are recomputed within that subsample.

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:lmg}, sociodemographic variables explain 10\% to 15\% of the variance in our main attitudinal outcomes, and this figure drops to 5\% after accounting for country and vote. In other words, although variables such as age and diploma are significantly correlated with attitudes (see Tables \ref{tab:determinant}-\ref{tab:determinants_custom_redistr}), differences in average acceptance of a policy between (say) age groups rarely exceed a dozen percentage points. In contrast, our measure of universalism is a stronger predictor than any sociodemographic variable. % TODO? move to subsec:debated ?

Appendix \ref{app:pol} shows how our main attitudinal outcomes vary by political leaning. Non-voters exhibit attitudes close to the center of the political spectrum. Besides, attitudes are much less polarized in Japan compared to Europe and the U.S. 
Figures \ref{fig:vote_pnr_out}-\ref{fig:vote_representativeness} show how our weighted samples compare to actual voting results in the most recent election. 
Although the proportion of self-reported non-voters is lower than in reality, voting patterns across the three main political leanings are similar to the actual distribution. 
Appendix \ref{app:vote} shows that our main results are robust to reweighting by vote. 

\paragraph{Data Quality.}\label{par:data_quality}
The median survey duration is 17 minutes (13 min in Russia). 
Best practices have been implemented  to ensure top-notch data quality \citep{stantcheva_how_2023}. 
The questionnaire was carefully worded in a neutral and informative way;\footnote{At the end of the survey, 70\% of the respondents find it politically unbiased (Figure \ref{fig:survey_biased}). The most common comment left by respondents in the feedback field is that the survey was ``interesting''; very few criticize it (Figure~\ref{fig:comment_field}).} tested on random people in public spaces to ensure correct comprehension; translated by professional translators, with figures converted into national currencies; and double-checked by native speakers.

Of all respondents who started the questionnaire, 23\% respondents were allowed to continue (as their quotas were not full). Among them, 17\% dropped out (including 10\% who dropped out after the socio-demographic questions). The final sample is obtained after excluding 16\% of respondents from the extended sample for suspicion of low quality: 9\% for failing an attention test and 13\% for completing the questionnaire in less than 6 minutes\footnote{6 minutes corresponds to 30\% of the expected median duration of 20 min. In Russia, the cutoff is 200 seconds, or 30\% of the expected median duration of 11 minutes.} (including 5\% for both reasons). 
Appendix \ref{app:attrition} checks for differential attrition and Appendix \ref{app:extended} shows that our main results replicate in the extended sample. 

The order of question items is randomized whenever possible. Appendix \ref{app:order} examines the effect of item order on answers. Item order generally has a significant but small effect (2 to 14~p.p.). The size of this effect helps identify questions for which opinions are strongly held (e.g. a preference for a sustainable scenario over the status quo) versus weakly held (e.g. the preferred amount of climate finance). % crystallized, well-formed, consolidated, stable, ambivalent

Appendix \ref{app:comparison} compares the responses to two attitudinal questions borrowed from other surveys. The overall averages differ by 2 to 4~p.p. and the cross-country correlations are high: .70 \citep{global_nation_global_2023} to .86 \citep{cappelen_majority_2025}. 

\paragraph{Incentives.}
The questionnaire includes three incentivized questions, each awarding a \$100 prize to one randomly selected winner. First, a comprehension question about the Global Climate Scheme (GCS) checks whether respondents understand the policy's cost. 
Second, a donation lottery allows respondents to choose what portion of the prize they would donate to a reforestation NGO, should they win. Third, a question assesses respondents' perception of the actual support for the GCS, rewarding a correct guess.

\paragraph{Survey Structure.}\label{par:flow}
While Appendix \ref{app:questionnaire} provides the full questionnaire, Figure \ref{fig:flow} depicts the survey flow with all random branches. The various treatments are independent and uniformly distributed. Whenever there is a treatment, the acceptance rates reported are computed using the control group. Appendix \ref{app:placebo} runs placebo tests to check if earlier treatments affect unrelated outcomes. % TODO in app:placebo, comment on effect size that overall support can be at most 1pp higher/lower due to unrelated treatments

\end{figure}

After collecting sociodemographic characteristics, the questionnaire begins with broad questions to assess the prioritization and salience of global solidarity before respondents become aware of the survey topic. First, respondents answer open-ended fields on either their main concerns, wants, issues of interest, or perceived injustices. Second, they complete a conjoint experiment where they have to select their preferred political program, or abstain. Both programs are randomly generated: each policy (or lack thereof) in five policy domains is selected at random from a pool of policies that are prominent in the country's public debate. Third, respondents allocate the revenue of a global wealth tax among five (national or global) spending items. 

Then follow attitudinal questions about the main policies studied: a \textit{Climate Scheme} at the national, global, or international level; an international wealth tax funding low-income countries; and ten plausible global solidarity policies. These questions include treatments that vary the international coverage of policies or test for warm glow. 

The final part of the questionnaire explores attitudes towards more radical global redistribution scenarios and includes more sophisticated questions, such as an interactive task in which respondents can choose their preferred custom redistribution of global incomes by manipulating sliders. 

The survey concludes with a comprehension question, synthetic questions (e.g. regarding one's moral circle), and a feedback field.

% \paragraph{Acceptance versus Support.} 

% Throughout the paper, I make a distinction between \textit{support} and \textit{acceptance}. I use the term \textit{support} to refer to the absolute share of \textit{Somewhat} or \textit{Strong support} on Likert scales, and \textit{acceptance} to refer to relative support --- specifically, the support share among non-\textit{Indifferent} responses. Although binary (\textit{Yes}/\textit{No}) questions are typically worded in terms of ``support'', I generally report their results using the term \textit{acceptance}. This approach avoids mistaking passive consent for active support among respondents who could not choose a neutral option.

\section{Salience and Prioritization of Global Solidarity\label{sec:salience}}
% - People view global poverty/ineq as big injustice though not salient concern (e.g. revenue_split)
In this section, I analyze the salience of global solidarity in undirected open-ended fields, and the prioritization of global programs in a budget allocation task.

\subsection{Top-of-mind Considerations}\label{subsec:considerations}

% TODO: check https://www.oecd.org/en/data/tools/oecd-better-life-index.html, literature on issue/concerns/wishes
At the beginning of the survey, respondents are randomly assigned one of four open-ended questions: their main concerns, their needs or wishes, an issue important to them but neglected in public debate, or the greatest injustice of all. The questions are deliberately broad and vague to let respondents express their top-of-mind considerations without any priming. 

To analyze the answers, I automatically translated each field into English.\footnote{I used \href{https://www.onlinedoctranslator.com/en/translationform}{onlinedoctranslator.com}, which is powered by \textit{Google Translate}.} 
Then, I used AI and my own reading of a few hundred answers to identify the most common concepts, from which I selected 27 categories. Next, I classified each answer into one or more of these categories, both manually (Figures \ref{fig:field_manual}-\ref{fig:injustice_field}) and automatically using AI (Figure \ref{fig:field_gpt}). Finally, I manually defined a list of 47 (conjunctions of) keywords and used it to automatically classify all responses.\footnote{The list of keywords is provided in Appendix \ref{subsec:keywords}.} Figure \ref{fig:field_keyword} reports the 24 most common keyword matches. 

The three different classification methods yield consistent results but differ in accuracy. While the keyword classification allows for an exact and reproducible search, the AI search is not limited to specific words and captures more matching responses. % Although the manual classification could be less consistent than the AI one (if e.g. the interpretation of the category changes over time or among coders), 
Overall, manual classification seems to provide the most accurate results, with a number of matches generally falling between those of the other two methods. 
For example, to the \textit{injustice} question, 1.2\% of answers match the keywords for \textit{global inequality} and ChatGPT identifies this category in 7.5\% of answers, versus 3.2\% according to my manual coding.\footnote{The keyword matching searches the regular expression ``global poverty|global inequal|hunger|drinking water|starv'', ignoring case. The automatic and manual classifications are based on the category definition ``Inequality at the inetrnational % inetrnational AER revision
level / Hunger or poverty in poor countries''.} 
Indeed, the AI incorrectly classifies unspecific answers like ``poverty'' in this category,\footnote{Interestingly, out of the 47  (one-word) answers ``poverty'', ChatGPT-4.1 only coded 42 of them as \textit{global inequality}, illustrating the lack of consistency of this classifier.} while the keyword search misses answers like ``inequality among humans''. 
Given this observation, I use the manual classification as the benchmark and the two other methods as robustness checks.

While less accurate than the classifications, word clouds (Figure \ref{fig:wordcloud}) provide a simple visualization of the most common concepts in each question. By far, the most frequent \textit{concerns} or \textit{wishes} of respondents relate to their purchasing power, with concepts such as ``money'', ``inflation'', the ``cost of living'', or ``financial stability'' appearing in 31\% of these fields. Within countries, the share of people concerned with money decreases with income: it ranges from 22\% in the top income decile to 35\% in the bottom one.\footnote{At the country level, the concern for money is significantly correlated with inequality (an additional point in the Gini index is associated with 0.8~p.p. more respondents concerned with money). %(a Gini index higher by 10 points is associated with 8~p.p. more respondents concerned with money). 
Interestingly, the concern for money is higher in richer countries, though the correlation vanishes once one controls for the Gini.} 
The next most frequent \textit{concerns} are health (or the healthcare system, 13\%), far-right governments (or related concepts such as ``Trump'' or ``trade tariffs, 10\%) and war (either in general or specific conflicts, such as the Gaza War, 9\%). Most \textit{wishes} are personal, with the next most frequent (after money) relating to one's own or one's relatives' health (21\%) or peace of mind (10\%). Interestingly, almost none of the responses mention relational considerations, such as love, friendships, loneliness, intimate life, or the desire to have children (except in Saudi Arabia, where the latter was mentioned). % shorten by cuttin the end?
Further research is needed to determine whether the predominance of materialistic considerations stems from the context (an impersonal survey) or truly reflects people's primary thoughts. % TODO check literature

  \end{subfigure} 
\end{figure}

Asked about the greatest \textit{injustice}, the most frequent answers relate to ``inequality'' or ``poverty'', with 19\% of occurrences (28\% in Europe but only 9\% in the U.S.). It is unclear whether these respondents are thinking about inequality in their own country or at the global level, since only 11\% of them specify a geographical scope. One clue is that 2\% mention their own country versus 10\% the global level (or Global South issues such as ``clean water'' or ``starvation''). Italians, Poles, and Spaniards are the most likely to mention ``global inequality'' or ``global poverty'', while Japanese and Russian respondents are the least likely to do so. 
The next most common answers relate to ``discrimination'' (based on gender, race, or sexual orientation, 9\%), ``violence'' or ``wrongful convictions'' (many respondents denounce the unjust sentencing of innocents, 9\%), or their country's ``welfare state'' (with people criticizing either the lack of public services or the excessive welfare given to undeserving people, 8\%). 

Asking people about ``an issue important to them but neglected in the public debate'' fails to uncover unusual topics. 21\% of respondents are unable to identify such an issue. %Although ``immigration'' is the most frequent word according to the word cloud, only 5\% of respondents refer to this issue, which comes after
The most frequently mentioned concepts are ``public services'' (12\%), the ``cost of living'' (10\%), ``health'' (9\%), ``ageing'' (6\%), and the ``environment'' (6\%).\footnote{Although ``immigration'' is one of the most frequent words according to the word cloud, the issue is only mentioned in 5\% of cases.} 
The fact that the most frequently mentioned topics are already well-publicized suggests that public debate reflects or shapes what people have in mind. % ``taxes'' or the ``welfare State'' (12\%), the ``healthcare system'' (9\%), the ``cost of living'' (9\%), and the ``environment'' (6\%).

Reading and coding each field one by one took about 30 hours, but it was worthwhile: not only does it result in an arguably more accurate classification; it also provided first-hand insight into how people think. For example, most people reason from their own perspective (e.g. ``my pension is too low'', ``I want to buy a house'') and do not refer to the broader picture or to political reforms. To get a sense of people's own words, a random display of responses can be found at \href{http://preferences-pol.fr/fields2025.html}{bit.ly/fields2025}.

% Interestingly, the topics vary significantly across countries. Here are my impressions of each country's slant. Compared to other countries, the concepts overrepresented in each country are as follows:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item France: insecurity, holidays or free time, the public deficit, equality, gender equality;
%   \item Germany: old age poverty, immigration, the return of growth or the economic situation, free time, war (in Europe), bureaucracy;
%   \item Italy: health, serenity or peace of mind, war, work stress and free time, world hunger, femicides; 
%   \item Poland: war, inequality, holidays, honesty, disabled people;
%   \item Spain: ``health, money and love'', housing, corruption, water access, global poverty, squatters;
%   \item the UK: the cost of living, immigration, having a comfortable life, mental health, the holocaust, roads dangerous for driving, being unjustly imprisoned, cut in winter fuel allowance;
%   \item Switzerland: equality, immigration, gender equality;
%   \item Japan: the level of pensions, a cut on the consumption tax, the price of rice, the declining birth rate, childcare support, reducing the number of parliament members, foreigners' preferential treatment, excessive social assistance or the lack of reward for hard work, stock prices;
%   \item Russia: metaphysical questions or profound interrogations, ``lies'', buying a house or a car, traveling, wanting to live;
%   \item Saudi Arabia: hobbies such as sports or soccer, the willingness to become millionaire (or billionaire), one's business project, buying a house, their car, that they are satisfied with their income, ``self-injustice'' or sin, raising children, Palestine, orphan's oppression, travels;
%   \item the U.S.: the economy, Trump, breaches to the Constitution, abortion, and gun control.
% \end{itemize}
The topics mentioned vary according to sociodemographic characteristics. For example, a respondent who mentions \textit{immigration} is 3.5 times more likely to vote for the far right (correlation of .17); one who mentions \textit{old age} is twice as likely to be 65 or older (correlation of .13). Beyond these examples, the strongest effects I find are that \textit{criticizing the far right} correlates with voting for the left (.16), mentioning \textit{health} with age (.11), \textit{employment} with being unemployed (.09), \textit{animals} with extendeding one's moral circle to sentient beings (.09), \textit{education} with being a student (.09), \textit{the environment} with voting for the left (.08), and \textit{money} with one's income ($-$.08).

Interestingly, the topics also vary significantly across countries. Below are my impressions of each country's slant. Compared to other countries, the concepts overrepresented in France are: insecurity, holidays or free time, the public deficit, equality, or gender equality; in Germany: old age poverty, immigration, the return of growth or the economic situation, free time, war (in Europe), and bureaucracy; in Italy: health, serenity or peace of mind, war, work stress and free time, world hunger, and femicides; in Poland: war, inequality, holidays, honesty, and disabled people; in Spain: ``health, money and love'', housing, corruption, water access, global poverty, and squatters; in the UK: the cost of living, immigration, having a comfortable life, mental health, the Holocaust, roads dangerous for driving, being unjustly imprisoned, and cuts to the winter fuel allowance; in Switzerland: equality, immigration, and gender equality; in Japan: the level of pensions, a cut to the consumption tax, the price of rice, the declining birth rate, childcare support, reducing the number of parliament members, foreigners' preferential treatment, excessive social assistance or the lack of reward for hard work, and stock prices; in Russia: metaphysical questions or profound interrogations, ``lies'', buying a house or a car, traveling, the desire to live; in Saudi Arabia: hobbies such as sports or soccer, the willingness to become millionaire (or billionaire), one's business project, buying a house, one's car, satisfaction with one's income, ``self-injustice'' or sin, raising children, Palestine, the oppression of orphans, and travel; in the U.S.: the economy, Donald Trump, breaches of the Constitution, abortion, and gun control. % TODO? shorten?

In summary, the low salience of global solidarity may explain why this topic fails to mobilize political forces, despite being referred to as a just cause and it being accepted by majorities (as shown below).

\subsection{Prioritization of Public Spending Items}\label{subsec:revenue_split}

% TODO? shorten/improve flow?
% revision: American -> US-American TODO AER
\cite{fabre_majority_2025} find that 58\% of US-Americans and 71\% of Western Europeans would support a global tax on millionaires funding low-income countries (LICs), with only 26\% and 14\% opposing it, respectively; around half of them would prefer to allocate half (rather than none) of the revenue from a global wealth tax to LICs; and, on average, respondents prefer to allocate 33.4\% of the revenue to LICs (versus domestic healthcare and education). 
% \cite{fabre_majority_2025} uses two random variants to study the preferred use of revenue from a global wealth tax between infrastructure and public services \textit{in
% low-income countries} versus \textit{domestic} healthcare and education. The ``binary'' variant shows that around half of US-Americans and Western Europeans prefer to allocate half (rather than none) of the revenue to low-income countries. The ``continuous'' variant shows that the median respondent prefers to allocate 30\% of the revenue to low-income countries (LICs).
In other words, while most people would prefer a globally redistributive tax to the status quo, the more leeway they are granted to allocate the revenue from such a tax, the less they would allocate to LICs. The greatest leeway tested by \cite{fabre_majority_2025} let the respondents select their preferred share for LICs versus one alternative spending item, and the average preference was 33.4\%---that is, 66.8\% of an equal split. % \footnote{The greatest leeway possible would be an open-ended field, but its interpretation would be challenging as answers that do not specify the geographical scope would be equivocal.}
Naturally, one expects respondents to split the revenue among all desirable spending items, so that the revenue allocated to one item depends on the number of items. Therefore, if LICs compete with not one but several national items, the share allocated to LICs is expected to diminish. 
If this share is less than 67\% of an equal split, it would mean that \citep{fabre_majority_2025} overestimated the prioritization of LICs, perhaps due to an excessive salience of LICs when only one alternative is proposed, or because the domestic alternative---healthcare and education---was not the most desired. % shorten by taking out this sentence? 
Conversely, if several items relate to a global issue, the total ``global spending'' should increase. 
If global spending increases by less than the proportionate amount for the number of global items, it could indicate that people view global items as a single entity and that some domestic issues were missing from the binary version. % shorten by taking out this sentence? 

To test whether the results in \citep{fabre_majority_2025} provide an accurate picture of the % relative
prioritization of global spending as well as to uncover the prioritization of different global causes, I conduct a revenue allocation task with five spending items. 
In each of the two variants of this task, respondents use sliders to allocate the revenue of a hypothetical global wealth tax (at a rate of 2\% on wealth in excess of \$5 million), after being informed of the revenue the tax would collect in their country (from \$1 billion in Poland to \$514 billion in the U.S.) versus in all LICs combined (\$1 billion). 

In the \textit{Few} variant, one global item (``Education, Healthcare and Renewable energy in LICs'') competes with four domestic ones. %(``Education and healthcare'', ``Social welfare programs'', ``Reduction in the income tax'', ``Reduction of the deficit''). 
In every country, the most prioritized item is ``Domestic: Education and healthcare'', with an average preferred share of 26\% (Figures \ref{fig:split_few_bars_nb0}, \ref{fig:split_few}). The global item is the least prioritized overall, at 17.5\% (from 14\% in Japan to 21\% in Saudi Arabia and Spain). However, global spending is the second most prioritized item in Europe (19\%) and Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, global spending is 31\% higher than the expected 13.4\% (that is, 66.8\% of % an equal split of 
20\%)\footnote{The one-sided test that global spending is equal to 33.4\% is rejected at the 1\% threshold in all countries except Japan, where it is rejected at the 10\% threshold. If one restricts the comparison to the countries surveyed by \citep{fabre_majority_2025}, the global item is allocated 17.8\%, which is 34\% more than expected. The most credible explanation for outperforming expectations is that the domestic item chosen by \citep{fabre_majority_2025} was the preferred one. Indeed, the global item is allocated 68\% of the ``Domestic: Healthcare and Education'' share, almost exactly as expected.} 
and only 13\% of respondents do not allocate any revenue to it (Figure \ref{fig:split}). 

%While these results reveal large acceptance of allocating a substantial share of the revenue from a global tax to LICs, this may result from framing the question with only two spending items (domestic versus LICs).

In the \textit{Many} variant, five items are selected at random from a pool of four global and nine domestic items. While domestic healthcare (27\%) %(27.0\%) 
and education (22\%) %(22.5\%) 
are the most prioritized items, the average allocation for global items ranges from 16\% %16.5\% 
for ``Forestation and biodiversity projects'' to 19\% %18.6\% 
for ``Education and Healthcare in LICs'' (Figures \ref{fig:split}, \ref{fig:split_many}-\ref{fig:split_many_global_mean}). On average, tasks include 1.5 global items, which together receive 26.9\% of the revenue --- again, equivalent to 17.5\% per global item. Interestingly, there is no significant correlation between the number of global items and the average allocation per global item.\footnote{In Russia, the question could not be asked in the same way due to different software. Instead, respondents had to choose what share of the global tax revenue to allocate to sustainable development in low-income countries. On average, Russians allocate 12.2\% to LICs, with a median allocation of just 5\%, but only 12\% allocate nothing to LICs.} % TODO! table allocation per global item ~ number of global items

Overall, the revenue allocation tasks validate and confirm the findings from \citep{fabre_majority_2025}. Most people would favor using a substantial share of the revenue from a global wealth tax to finance sustainable development in LICs, even though global spending is somewhat less prioritized than domestic spending. 


\section{Acceptance of %International 
Policies as a Function of Country Coverage\label{sec:coverage}}
% - Strong support for global tax / GCS even with partial participation

While acceptance of global climate or redistributive policies is widespread \citep{fabre_majority_2025,cappelen_majority_2025}, acceptance may drop if policies are not truly \textit{global} but only \textit{international}, i.e. if key countries such as China, Russia, or the U.S. do not participate. Indeed, people may be concerned about a domestic loss of competitiveness resulting from the expatriation of taxpayers to low-tax jurisdictions; or about unfair burden-sharing if non-cooperating countries free-ride on decarbonization or sustainable development funding. % TODO! cite Gampfer, Carlsson, Bechtel Scheve 2013 May also depend on which countries are in
In this section, I examine the acceptance of globally redistributive policies depending on the coalition of countries that would implement them. I study, in turn, a carbon price and a wealth tax.

\subsection{International Climate Scheme}\label{subsec:ics}

% TODO!! cite Beiser-McGrath \& Bernauer (2019), Sivonen (2022): +15pp if all countries rather than just half in CN, US
% NB: I chose to present GCS on control. Trade-off between presenting control results (not contaminated by treatment though less precise) and overall results (more comparable to ICS as those mix treated and control, though less comparable to NCS). I prioritized presenting results for themselves rather than for comparison with ICS.

\paragraph{Presentation of the Schemes.} ``Cap and dividend'' is a reference climate policy \citep{grubb_greenhouse_1990,bertram_tradeable_1992,baer_equity_2000,barnes_creating_2008,blanchard_major_2021}, % TODO ,young-brun_within-country_2025 ? ,jamieson_climate_2001,rajan_global_2021 3554_economists_economists_2019
whereby fossil fuel companies at the source of emissions must buy emission permits on a carbon market, with the revenue from carbon pricing rebated equally to individuals. The limited and declining number of emission permits guarantees that emissions are capped according to the climate objective. As polluting companies pass the cost of emission permits down the value chain, the carbon price is ultimately paid by consumers, in proportion to their carbon footprint. Meanwhile, the equal cash transfer (or ``dividend'') offsets price increases for the average consumer. Those with a higher-than-average carbon footprint financially lose, while those with a lower carbon footprint (who are on average poorer) financially gain. 
% explanation cap & dividend

Using simple \textit{Yes}/\textit{No} questions, I test the acceptance of three types of ``cap and dividend'' (or ``Climate Scheme'') policies that differ by geographical scope: the National, Global, and International Climate Schemes (Figures \ref{fig:ics}, \ref{fig:ncs_gcs_ics}). While average consumers in a high-income country are financially unaffected by the National Climate Scheme (NCS), they lose out in the Global and International versions, since their carbon footprint is larger than the world (or climate coalition) average. % TODO? acceptance => support?

% One random third of the respondents are asked for their support of the National Climate Scheme (NCS). It % DONE put back? no
The National Climate Scheme (NCS) 
is accepted by 68\% of respondents (ranging from 56\% in Poland to 88\% in Saudi Arabia). 
% majority support NCS (TODO!!? cite Douenne & Fabre? Mildenberger?)

\paragraph{The Global Climate Scheme.} 
Before presenting the Global Climate Scheme (GCS), respondents are instructed to pay careful attention, with the incentive that they may win a \$100 lottery prize if they correctly answer a comprehension question at the end of the survey. 
When presented with the Global Climate Scheme (GCS), respondents are informed that the cash transfer would lift 600~million people out of extreme poverty, and the cost to them is made salient. Respondents are informed of the amount of the cash transfer, as well as the price increases and the net cost to the average person in their country (e.g. 2\% price increases and a net cost of \$90 per month in the U.S., or 2\% and \euro{}45 per month in Germany).%
\footnote{The computations use a carbon price of \$95/tCO$_\text{2}$. For Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the U.S., computations assume universal country coverage and the cash transfer is \$35 per month. 
For Europe and Japan, the net loss is computed in a non-universal but \textit{High} participation scenario, which implies a lower cash transfer (\euro{}20 per month) and a higher net cost (by about \$10 per month) since the coalition's average carbon footprint is lower than the world average.} 
The GCS is accepted by 55\% of respondents (from 49\% in the U.S. and Russia to 85\% in Saudi Arabia). The salience of costs in the GCS question may explain the somewhat lower acceptance of the GCS compared to the NCS.%
\footnote{Acceptance of the GCS is also around 10~p.p. lower than in \citep{fabre_majority_2025}. There may be different reasons for this: attitudes may have changed in the two-year interval; I added information on the price increases, which allows respondents to estimate the cost to themselves (rather than to their average fellow citizen)%; and the framing might have been slightly confusing in the earlier survey as the GCS was presented on the same page as a national redistribution scheme revision put back? 100 countries instead of 60%?
.} 

% is top3_tax 5.1% of world income or HIC income? => World, but overestimated (in reality it's 4.3%) due to "rounding" errors when interpolating from countries distrib to world distrib using too coarse an interpolation => give figures in PPP nominal (4.7%) terms + PPP (4.3%) in footnote
\paragraph{Pluralistic Ignorance.} 
After assessing support for the GCS, respondents are asked in an incentivized way about their belief concerning the actual support, either in their country or in the U.S. (Figure \ref{fig:ncs_gcs_ics}).\footnote{US-Americans are asked about either their country or the EU. In Russia, I was not permitted to enquire about beliefs in a foreign country.} 
In every country and for any variant of the question, actual support is underestimated. The median respondent underestimates the support in their own country by 16~p.p. and the support in the U.S. by 22~p.p. In Japan and in European countries, the underestimation is more severe, with most people wrongly believing that the GCS does not garner majority support in their country. Such pluralistic ignorance might explain why politicians do not dare to propose global climate justice policies. 

\paragraph{International Climate Scheme.}
To test how country coverage influences the acceptance of the International Climate Scheme (ICS), respondents are randomly assigned to one of four variants. They can visualize the country coverage on a map (see examples in Figure \ref{fig:ics_maps}), where their own country is striped to denote its potential participation. Respondents are also informed of the number of countries that would participate in the assigned scenario, the list of these countries or world regions, and their share of world emissions.

The \textit{Mid} scenario covers 56\% of world emissions and includes China and Global South countries. The \textit{Low} scenario replaces China with the EU and covers 33\% of emissions. The \textit{High scenario} adds various high-income countries to the \textit{Mid} scenario, including the EU, Japan, Canada, and South Korea, and covers 72\% of emissions. The last variant, \textit{High color}, combines the \textit{High} participation scenario with a colored map that displays not only the country coverage, but also the net gain or cost for each country, with China appearing as neither gaining nor losing from the policy.\footnote{In a standard cap and dividend, China should lose, as its carbon footprint exceeds the world average. However, the Global Climate Scheme departs slightly from the standard policy so that middle-income countries do not lose out \citep{fabre_global_2025}.}

\end{figure}

As expected, the wider the coverage, the higher the acceptance. However, this effect is relatively small, as acceptance is only 4~p.p. higher in the \textit{High} variant (at 68\%) compared to the \textit{Low} variant (65\%). Interestingly, acceptance among Europeans significantly increases when China is added to the coalition, but does not rise further 
when other HICs are also added. Conversely, for US-Americans and Japanese, the participation of the EU or China yields similar levels of acceptance, and only the combined participation of China, the EU, and other HICs significantly increases acceptance. 

The effect of country coverage is entirely driven by the 74\% of respondents who understand that the GCS would result in increased gasoline prices. It is worth noting that acceptance is higher among the minority of respondents who misunderstand the policy: by 5~p.p. for the GCS and 4~p.p. for the ICS. % gcs_support no longer majority in PL among understanders; but ics_high_color_support majority in every country among understanders

Acceptance is 6.6~p.p. lower in the \textit{High color} variant compared to the \textit{High} variant. Three reasons may explain this effect. First, the cost may be more salient with the colored map. %Indeed, the map appears to be informative even to the 74\% of respondents who understand that the GCS would result in increased gasoline prices, as the effect is just as high for them as for the other respondents. Second, some respondents may be concerned by the information (made explicit in the question) that China would neither gain nor lose from the policy. 
Third, with the colored map, respondents learn how their own country fares compared to others. In fact, the effect % TODO? (of lower support)
is %1~p.p. and 
no longer significant (and of opposite sign) for countries that appear to lose less than 0.5\% of their GDP (Spain and Switzerland). 
% Interestingly, acceptance of the GCS and of non-\textit{color} variants of the ICS are 5~p.p. lower for the 74\% of respondents who understand that the GCS would result in increased gasoline prices (after controlling for sociodemographics), but this effect is only 2~p.p. and no longer significant for the \textit{High color} ICS, indicating that the information provided by the map affects those who had not yet understood the policy's consequences. => no, the effect comes from understanders being more reactive to high country coverage.

Notice that acceptance of the ICS in the \textit{Low} coverage variant is similar to that of the NCS. This suggests that the average respondent is willing to pay the ICS's higher cost for the guarantee of poverty alleviation and decarbonization in the Global South. %This suggests that, for the average person, the guarantee of poverty alleviation and decarbonization in the Global South balances out the ICS's higher cost. 

Finally, the greater acceptance of the ICS compared to the GCS is somewhat puzzling. Perhaps people view the proposal as more credible when a list of participating countries is provided, compared to the GCS, which is framed as if all countries might join (or, on the contrary, as one in which the participation of any country is uncertain). Relatedly, acceptance may be stronger for more precise or more visual proposals, either because they are viewed as more advanced or because they induce an experimenter demand bias. The greater acceptance could also be due to costs being less salient in the ICS question (but acceptance is still greater than in the GCS in the \textit{High color} variant, where costs are visible). Unfortunately, the data does not allow testing these different hypotheses.

% support increases with coverage
% ICS low: similar to NCS: people willing to pay Global South for its decarbonization

\subsection{Wealth Tax Funding LICs}\label{subsec:wealth_tax}

I test the effect of country coverage on the acceptance of an internationally redistributive wealth tax using a simple \textit{Yes}/\textit{No} question with three random variants. The policy is described as a 2\% tax on wealth above \$1~million, with 30\% of its revenue financing public services in LICs. In the \textit{Global} variant, all countries except the respondent's own are assumed to participate. The \textit{HIC} variant covers all HICs (except the respondent's country). The \textit{International} variant covers some countries and not others, with the precise coverage varying by respondent's country but always including Brazil and European countries (or the whole EU) and excluding China and the U.S.\footnote{More precisely, in the U.S., excluded countries differ and are \textit{China, Japan, and Canada}. As for included countries, in addition to \textit{Brazil}, they are: \textit{the EU and the UK} for Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, and the U.S.; \textit{the EU} for Russia and the UK; and \textit{France, Germany, Spain, and the UK (except one's own country)} for EU countries.}

Here again, acceptance increases with the country coverage, but the effect is small. The middle-ground \textit{HIC} variant garners 70\% acceptance (from 58\% in Switzerland to 81\% in Saudi Arabia). Compared to \textit{HIC}, acceptance is 5~p.p. higher with \textit{Global} coverage, while it is only 1.4~p.p. and non-significantly lower with \textit{International} coverage (Figure \ref{fig:wealth_tax}).

Overall, the results indicate that the acceptance of internationally redistributive policies is quite robust to country coverage. This suggests that the issues of competitiveness or free riding are not decisive factors in public support. % TODO!!? cite literature

\section{Sincerity of Support for Global Redistribution\label{sec:sincerity}}

Skeptics about the public's support for global redistribution would argue that this support is not reflected in real-stake decisions or that it mostly results from \textit{warm glow}. According to the \textit{warm glow} hypothesis, many people would express their support to enjoy moral comfort as long as the policy appears out of reach and supporting it seems harmless. In case of \textit{warm glow}, support would vanish if (\textit{i}) the prospect of implementation materialized or if (\textit{ii}) moral comfort could be obtained from a substitute. In this section, I test whether global redistribution is a vote-determining issue using a conjoint analysis, and I test both forms of \textit{warm glow} (\textit{i} and \textit{ii}) using two other survey experiments.
% - No (or little) evidence of warm glow or support due to unrealism; global redistr genuinely supported (conjoint analysis)

\subsection{Conjoint Analysis}\label{subsec:conjoint}

I conduct a conjoint experiment in all countries except Russia and Saudi Arabia. This question is positioned at the beginning of the survey, before respondents know the survey's topic. Respondents are presented with two random political programs, framed as the fictitious programs of the leading candidates in the next election, and are asked which candidate they would vote for (27\% of the respondents choose the outside option \textit{Neither of them}). Each program contains a policy or an absence of policy, chosen at random, for each of five policy domains (the order of which is also randomized). %: \textit{Economic issues}, \textit{Social issues}, \textit{Climate policy}, \textit{Tax system}, \textit{Foreign policy}. 
Our domain of interest is \textit{Foreign policy}, whose pool contains three policies: \textit{Cut development aid}, \textit{International tax on millionaires with 30\% financing healthcare and education in low-income countries}, and a country-specific policy. % (e.g. \textit{Support Ukraine militarily and financially} in Germany). 
I included both an \textit{anti}- and a \textit{pro}-global redistribution policy to capture a potential status quo bias or, on the contrary, a bias in favor of reform. 
The policies, except for these two of interest, have been selected from the programs of the main candidates in the country's most recent election, ensuring coverage of the entire political spectrum and the most prominent proposals in the national public debate. 

Figure \ref{fig:conjoint} shows the effect of including our policies of interest in a program on the likelihood that it is preferred (see Figures \ref{fig:conjoint_FR}-\ref{fig:conjoint_ES_original} for full country-by-country results\footnote{With a few exceptions, \textit{raising the minimum wage} is among the most popular policies, alongside \textit{redistributive taxes or transfers}, \textit{anti-immigration regulations}, and \textit{abortion rights}. 
Conversely, \textit{a ban on new combustion-engine cars} is among the least popular ones.}). 
% Why Japan millionaire significant in conjoint_JP but not in conjoint? => because in conjoint_JP the formula includes all domains vs. only foreign policy in conjoint. SEs are the same but the coef is lower in conjoint_JP. => In conjoint_JP, the coef is the marginal effect when every domain is "-", while in conjoint it's the marginal effect at the mean (compared to foreign at "-").
More specifically, Figure \ref{fig:conjoint} presents the results %estimates of coefficients $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ 
of the following regression, estimated by simple OLS with standard errors clustered by respondent: 
$$\text{Preferred}_{pi} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Cut\_aid}_{pi} + \beta_2 \text{Intl\_tax}_{pi} + \beta_3 \text{Foreign3}_{pi} + \varepsilon_{pi}$$

% TODO? include controls for consistency with warm glow?

Both policies significantly affect program choice: the internationally redistributive millionaire tax increases the likelihood that a program is preferred by 4~p.p., while cutting development aid decreases it by 4~p.p. At the country level, the effects are generally non-significant due to lack of power, but when significant, they are of the same sign as the global effect (except for \textit{cut aid} in Switzerland). Overall, the effects are of comparable size to the effects of other policies,\footnote{Overall, the average absolute effect size (weighted by countries' population sizes) is 6~p.p., and our effects of interest are not significantly lower than this average (at the 15\% threshold).} % \footnote{Compared to the average absolute effect size (weighted by countries' population sizes), our effects of interest are 31\% lower on (weighted) average, but the difference is not statistically significant.} %
suggesting that global redistribution issues may be as vote-determining as policies prominent in the national debate. 

One concern with this type of conjoint analysis is that it involves unrealistic political programs, namely programs that contain both left and far-right policies, which distorts the actual choices that voters may face. \cite{de_la_cuesta_improving_2022} showed that to fully address this issue, one should weigh each pair of programs by the probability that it would arise in a real election. Since this probability cannot be computed, the best practice is to bound the effects by estimating them with extreme probabilities. The results just presented are based on one extreme, the uniform distribution. To construct the other extreme, I classify each policy proposal according to its originating political party%as left, center, or right,%
\footnote{Interestingly, the most popular policies originate from left-wing parties, except in Germany and Switzerland. 
Indeed, the average deviation from the mean effect is highest for policies originating from the \textit{Left}, and lowest for those from the \textit{Center-right or Right}. 
%To study the popularity of policies as a function of the party that propose them, 
% In the main specification, I use a manual classification which assigns \textit{center} to policies actually supported by the left or far right when they seem compatible with any political leaning. 
% Interestingly, 
% % among the policies most ``popular'' in a given country, I have classified five of them as \textit{center} and four as \textit{left}. However, in reality, seven of these policies are proposed by a party from the \textit{left}, two from the \textit{far right}, and \textit{none} from the \textit{center}. Other analyses confirm that 
% policies originating from the \textit{left} are the most popular (except in Germany and Switzerland), even though I often classify them as \textit{center}. 
% Actually, policies originating from a \textit{center} party are the least popular, but policies I classify as \textit{center} are the most popular. % are overrepresented among most liked policies. %I classify as \textit{center} are overrepresented among most liked policies, but that considering the party they originate from, \textit{center} policies are \textit{under}represented among most liked policies and overrepresented among \textit{least} liked policies, while policies from the \textit{left} are overrepresented among most liked policies.
} 
and consider a program consistent if it does not contain policies from both the \textit{left} and the \textit{far right}. Then, I re-estimate the regression after dropping the 29\% of pairs with an inconsistent program, effectively assigning them a probability of zero. Effects are preserved: +4~p.p. for the tax and $-$4~p.p. for cutting aid.\footnote{In the main specification, I consider our policies of interest as consistent with any program. As an alternative, I classify them as either \textit{left} (for the tax) or \textit{far right} (for cutting aid). In that case, only 43\% of observations are retained, yet effects are still preserved (+4~p.p. for the tax and $-$5~p.p. for cutting aid).} 
This indicates that our results are robust to the critique of \cite{de_la_cuesta_improving_2022}. 
% Interestingly, the effects differ when I classify our policies of interest as \textit{left} (for the tax) and \textit{right} (for cutting aid), in which case only 39\% of observations are retained. In this case, the effect of the millionaire tax is preserved, but the effect of cutting aid vanishes to 0~p.p. In other words, the effect of cutting aid disappears when left-leaning programs containing it are removed, while the effect of the tax remains unchanged when right-leaning programs containing it are removed. Therefore, cutting aid is harmful only to left-leaning programs, while a wealth tax benefits any program. Interestingly, this does \textit{not} mean that only left-wing voters oppose cutting aid while an international wealth tax would be vote-determining for right-wing voters. Indeed, the results by vote show that the tax has a negative (though non-significant) effect among right and far-right voters, while cutting aid has a weakly significant effect of $-$2.4~p.p. ($p$ = .097) on \textit{Center-right or Right} voters (Figure \ref{fig:conjoint_vote}). 
% These observations can be reconciled by noting that some non-voters and right-wing voters may opt for left-wing programs, and vice versa. % shorten: cut last sentence

\subsection{Testing Warm Glow}\label{subsec:warm_glow}

Some people might claim to support a policy of global redistribution merely to ease their conscience. If support were mainly due to this psychological mechanism, called \textit{warm glow}, it might
dissipate when the prospect of the policy materializes or if the policy support could be replaced by a substitute with the same moral appeal.

\paragraph{Moral Substitute.}

Following \cite{nunes_identifying_2003}, warm glow would be revealed if support for the GCS decreased after respondents are offered the opportunity to express generosity towards the cause of climate change. To test this hypothesis, right before the GCS page, I assign a random subset of the respondents to a donation lottery, while the control group faces no question.\footnote{More precisely, right before the GCS question, the sample is split into three branches: the \textit{Donation} lottery, the \textit{NCS} question, and the control group. The NCS treatment is excluded from this analysis as it is unrelated to this experiment (restricting the NCS question to a subsample was done to prevent it from influencing responses to the GCS).} 
In the \textit{Donation} branch, respondents must decide how much they would donate to the reforestation NGO \textit{Just One Tree}, should they win the question's \$100 lottery. 
Lower support for the GCS in the treated group would be evidence of warm glow, as it would indicate that the support derives (at least partially) from moral satisfaction at having recently supported a just cause.

\end{figure}

On the contrary, support for the GCS is 3.5~p.p. higher in the \textit{Donation} branch compared to the control group, and the coefficient is positive in every country, though often not significant (Figure \ref{fig:warm_glow_substitute}). While the reason for this positive effect remains unclear,\footnote{Perhaps the \textit{Donation} question triggers thoughts favorable to the GCS, such as the realization that individual actions like donations are ill-suited to address climate change, so that we need a global policy, even if it is imperfect.} 
the results show no evidence of warm glow.

\paragraph{Realism Treatment.}

To test the hypothesis that some people express support for global redistribution only as long as its implementation seems unlikely, I randomly assign half of the respondents to receive information about ongoing negotiations on globally redistributive policies. Among other things, treated respondents are informed that the International Maritime Organization recently adopted a levy on maritime carbon emissions that should partly finance LICs; that the G20 considered introducing a global tax on billionaires; that the UN General Assembly recently agreed on the principle of expanding the UN Security Council to new members; and that the UN Secretary-General supports financial system reforms that would drive resources towards sustainable development (see Question~\ref{q:info_solidarity}). 
Then, respondents are asked ``how likely [it is] that international policies involving significant transfers from HICs to LICs will be introduced in the next 15 years'', right before their support for ten plausible global policies is tested.\footnote{Section \ref{subsec:debated} reports acceptance of these policies and Appendix~\ref{subsec:plausible_policies_sources} describes the corresponding international negotiations.}  Here, warm glow would be revealed if the information treatment increased the belief that global redistribution is likely but decreased support for global policies. %(as respondents would fear that such policies may materialize).

The treatment was designed to satisfy the exclusion restriction required for the instrumental variables (IV) strategy. The exclusion restriction states that the treatment affects support for global policies only through its impact on beliefs that global redistribution is likely. Table \ref{tab:iv} reports the corresponding regression results. Although the treatment is randomly assigned, the preferred specification includes the sociodemographic variables as controls to improve precision.\footnote{In fact, some effects are no longer significant in the specification without controls, with $p$-values for the IV and the direct effect at .11 and .12, respectively.} Informed respondents are 7~p.p. more likely to believe that global redistribution is likely, from a baseline of 33\% in the control group. With an effective F-statistic of 67, this highly significant effect provides a strong first stage for the IV estimation. Assuming that the exclusion restriction holds, the IV is well identified. The local average treatment effect estimated by 2SLS is 18~p.p., indicating that believing global redistribution is likely causally \textit{increases} the share of global policies supported. This estimate is consistent with both the non-causal OLS coefficient of 15~p.p. and the direct effect of the treatment on policy support, estimated at 1~p.p. (see Figure \ref{fig:warm_glow_realism}).

\end{table}

Again, the effects go in the opposite direction to warm glow. In this case, increased support may stem from enhanced credibility of policies that are known to be discussed in international organizations. 
Overall, the results of these two experiments provide no evidence that support for global redistribution is affected by warm glow. On the contrary, they suggest that support is sincere and robust to the prospect of implementation or to the possibility of a moral substitute.


\section{Breadth of Accepted International Policies\label{sec:breadth}}

Knowing that some internationally redistributive policies are sincerely supported and may influence voting behavior, I now examine the range of international policies that could be accepted. In this section, I analyze, in turn, the support for global policies currently debated in the international community, as well as more radical proposals; I also assess broader willingness to defend global solidarity, the preferred channels to transfer resources to LICs, and a custom redistribution task designed to reveal the preferred extent of international transfers. 
% - People ready to sustainability and radical global redistr (for duty, not reparations)
% - People favor social protection to unconditional transfers

\subsection{Acceptance of Currently Debated Global Policies}\label{subsec:debated}

\paragraph{Plausible Global Policies.}

Figure \ref{fig:solidarity_support_share} reveals the acceptance of plausible global policies. %, i.e. the share of \textit{Somewhat} or \textit{Strong support} among non-\textit{Indifferent} answers. % TODO? (also known as relative support)
These policies are deemed ``plausible'' because they are debated in international organizations, as detailed in Appendix~\ref{subsec:plausible_policies_sources}. Almost every policy garners majority acceptance % TODO? relative majority support?
in each country. The only exception is the acceptance among Japanese respondents of a globally redistributive tax on carbon emissions from aviation, at 46\%. 
This proposal has the most salient cost: a 30\% increase in flight prices. It is the least % absolute
supported in every country. 
The policies with the most acceptance, above 70\% %of relative support 
in every country, are the 2\% minimum tax on billionaires' wealth proposed by \cite{zucman_blueprint_2024} and the expansion of low-interest-rate sustainable investments in LICs \citep{bridgetown_initiative_bridgetown_2025}.

\end{figure}

% The share of plausible policies supported ranges from 38\% in Japan to 66\% in Saudi Arabia and 65\% in Italy. Conversely, the share of policies opposed is highest in Switzerland (29\%), Poland %(23\%) 
% and the U.S. (23\%). The other questions exhibit a similar ranking of countries. 

\paragraph{Ranking of Countries in Terms of Support for Global Redistribution.}\label{par:ranking}

On average, respondents support 51\% of the plausible policies and oppose 21\% of them. This means they support +30~p.p. more policies than they oppose (Figure~\ref{fig:synthetic_indicators_mean}). The countries with the highest mean difference between support and opposition are Saudi Arabia (+50~p.p.), Italy (+49) and Spain (+39). In contrast, net support is lowest in Japan (+20), Switzerland (+24), Poland, and the U.S. (+25). % Actually, Poland has .08% higher net support than the U.S.
% TODO fig:synthetic_indicators_mean on control group

Other synthetic indicators of support for global redistribution show consistent country rankings. In particular, the countries previously identified as having the highest and lowest net support retain their rankings when ordered by average latent support for global redistribution (Figure~\ref{fig:synthetic_indicators_mean}). 
To construct this latent variable, I standardize all variables of support and average them, weighted by loadings obtained from an exploratory factor analysis (see details and loading weights in Appendix~\ref{subsec:efa}). 
% Methodologically, I construct this latent variable by averaging all variables of support in the survey, standardized and weighted by loadings obtained by an exploratory factor analysis (see details and loading weights in Appendix~\ref{subsec:efa}). 

One might wonder why the countries leading in support are the Saudi kingdom and right-wing-dominated Italy. Breaking down the support by political leaning and other selected sociodemographics, Figures \ref{fig:main_radical_redistr_pol}-\ref{fig:synthetic_indicators_pol_mean} shed some light on this question. In Saudi Arabia, half of the adult population is immigrant. % 51.5%
However, foreign workers do not drive the results, as Saudi citizens exhibit slightly higher support than non-Saudis.\footnote{Therefore, tentative explanations may rather come from Saudi society. While Saudis benefit from a generous welfare state, the Islamic principle of \textit{Zakat} (almsgiving) might further foster a culture of generosity.} 
As for Italy, it is both the country with the lowest gap in support between left-wing and far-right voters (along with Japan, at 33~p.p.) and the country with the highest support among left-wing voters.\footnote{While the former point may be linked to the vision of Italy's far-right leader of an Africa-Italy partnership (trading off foreign aid with cooperation ion fighting immigration), the Italian population might also be influenced by the Vatican's messages in favor of global solidarity.} 
% TODO: to analyze Saudi anomaly: correlation between optimism (well-being) and support: .13*** at country level
% TODO: correlation between growth and support: .07***

\paragraph{Climate Finance Goal.}\label{par:ncqg}

Climate finance refers to the financing of climate action in developing countries by developed countries. In 2024, countries agreed on a ``New Collective Quantified Goal'' (NCQG) of climate finance set at \$300~billion per year by 2035, which is triple the previous goal. However, while developing countries such as India called for \$600~billion in grants (or grant-equivalent funding), the NCQG does not specify the share of finance that should be provided as grants. Currently, the goal is being met with only \$26~billion in grants and the remainder in loans \citep{oecd_climate_2024}. 

I test the preferred amount for the NCQG in grant-equivalent terms, using two random variants. Both variants inform respondents of the current situation and the agreed goal, expressing amounts in both absolute terms and as a proportion of developed countries' GDP. The \textit{Short} variant uses qualitative, textual responses, and features a middle category of \$100~billion (namely, ``Meet the newly agreed goal by tripling grants and loans (\$100 billion in grants, or 0.15\% of GDP).''). The \textit{Long} variant provides more detailed explanations in the question text and then uses numerical answers, with a midpoint of \$300~billion. 

In both variants, the median preferred NCQG is \$100~billion, with 19\% of respondents choosing an amount of \$600~billion or larger (Figures~\ref{fig:ncqg}-\ref{fig:ncqg_full}). 

That differently framed variants yield consistent results suggests that, despite its length, the question was well understood. 
The median choice of a climate finance quantum in line with the internationally agreed NCQG can be interpreted in two distinct ways. Either diplomats of HICs are defending the level of generosity that reflects the median preferences of their compatriots, or respondents' attitudes are anchored in existing agreements (or in their governments' stance). The results presented below are more consistent with the latter interpretation, as they reveal majority acceptance of much larger international transfers.


\subsection{Support for Radical Proposals, Political Action, and Broad Values}\label{subsec:radical}

In the final part of the questionnaire, I pose a variety of questions to assess the range of global solidarity policies, actions or values that people may accept (Figure \ref{fig:radical_redistr_share}).

\paragraph{Sustainable Future versus Status Quo.}\label{par:sustainable_future}

Respondents were asked which scenario they would prefer for the next twenty years: a sustainable future or the status quo (note that scenarios were not labeled that way in the questionnaire, but were instead randomly named \textit{A} or \textit{B}). In the sustainable scenario, most countries cooperate to tax millionaires and meet the +2\textdegree{}C target, through the electrification of cars and the doubling of prices for heating fuel or gas, air travel, and beef. Although overall purchasing power is preserved (through a reduction in sales tax), people change their habits (e.g. flying and eating meat are cut by half). In the status quo, no policy is implemented, people maintain their lifestyles, and global warming reaches +3\textdegree{}C by 2100, causing more severe disasters.

Overall, 68\% of respondents prefer the sustainable future over the status quo.

\paragraph{Global Income Redistribution.}\label{par:global_income_redistr}

I test the support for a global tax on top incomes to finance poverty reduction in LICs, with the tax targeting either the global top~1\% or top~3\%, depending on random assignment. The top~1\% variant describes an additional 15\% tax on income in excess of \$120,000 per year (at Purchasing Power Parity), while the top~3\% variant features additional rates of 15\%, 30\%, and 45\% above \$80,000, \$120,000, and \$1~million, respectively. Each tax is calibrated to finance the poverty gap, with poverty defined using thresholds of \$250 and \$400 per month for the top~1\% and top~3\% variants, respectively. These taxes entail international transfers of 2\% and 5\% of world nominal income, respectively (see Appendix~\ref{subsec:country_features} for details). 
Two numerical examples explain to respondents how the tax would affect taxpayers' income. The question also states the share of affected taxpayers worldwide and in their country, as well as the share of their country's GDP that would be transferred. For example, in the U.S., the top~1\% tax would affect the top 8\% and transfer 3\% of GDP, while the top~3\% tax would affect the top 18\% and transfer 8\% of GDP (see Figure~\ref{fig:top_tax_share}). These figures are about half as high in Japan and Germany, and around four times lower in France and Spain.

Overall, 56\% (resp. 50\%) of the respondents support the top~1\% (resp. top~3\%) tax, and 25\% (resp. 28\%) oppose it (Figure~\ref{fig:top_tax_positive}). 
% There is majority acceptance %relative majority support for

majority acceptance 
even among the 6\% of respondents who would be affected, though this is not the case in every country for the top~3\% variant (Figure~\ref{fig:top_tax_affected_share}). 

\paragraph{Global Convergence.}\label{par:convergence}

A simple question captures the acceptance of global solidarity: ``Should governments actively cooperate to have all countries converge in terms of GDP per capita by the end of the century?'' Overall, 61\% answer \textit{Yes} and 26\% \textit{No}, with the lowest relative agreement (i.e. excluding people not responding%choosing not to answer
) in the U.S., at 56\%.

\paragraph{Willingness to Act.}\label{par:willingness_act}

Two questions asked the respondents how they would react to a ``worldwide movement in favor of a global program to tackle climate change, implement taxes on millionaires and fund poverty reduction in [LICs]''. 

% TODO! compare this to Cappelen et al
In a multiple-choice question (censored in Russia), 29\% report they could participate in the movement by either attending a demonstration (19\%), going on strike (7\%), or donating \$100 to a strike fund (10\%). This share rises to 68\% in favor of the movement when including the 52\% of respondents who ``could sign a petition and spread ideas'' for the movement (Figure \ref{fig:global_movement}). 
Taken at face value, these results would mean that a successful global solidarity movement could collect up to \$10~billion and organize some of the largest demonstrations in history, matching Earth Day mobilizations.\footnote{On April 22, 1970, 20 million US-Americans (10\% of the population) demonstrated for the environment. Since then, Earth Day events regularly mobilize hundreds of millions of people worldwide.} % TODO? cut for AER?
Interestingly, 52\% of the 584 millionaires\footnote{In the weighted subsample of millionaires, 60\% are US-Americans and 26\% Europeans.} who answered the survey would be in favor of such a movement.

When asked whether they would be more or less likely to vote for the political party they feel closest to if it were part of such a movement, 36\% of the respondents state they would be more likely versus 17\% less likely (Figure \ref{fig:vote_intl_coalition}). Among the 5\% of respondents who did not vote in the last election and feel closest to a left-wing party, the share more likely to vote in that case increases to 46\% (versus 10\% who are less likely). 

\paragraph{Reasons for Helping LICs.}\label{par:why_help_lic}

In a multiple-choice question, I asked respondents which reasons for HICs supporting LICs they agree with, among arguments involving \textit{duty}, \textit{long-term interest}, or \textit{historical responsibility}. At 54\%, the reason most frequently chosen in every country (except France) is \textit{duty}, specifically ``Helping countries in need is the right thing to do'' (Figure \ref{fig:why_hic_help_lic}). Additionally, 38\% select \textit{interest}, and 25\% \textit{responsibility}, with only 16\% disagreeing with every reason.

\paragraph{Reparations.}\label{par:reparations}
% TODO past or present when describing the survey?

In former colonial or slave States,\footnote{I did not ask this question in Japan or Russia, because these countries' historiographies do not present their past as colonial but rather  as an empire% larger ``empire''
.} 
I asked respondents whether they would support ``reparations for colonization and slavery to former colonies and descendants of slaves'', specifying that the reparations ``could take the form of funding education and facilitating technology transfers''. Consistent with the general disagreement that HICs have a \textit{historical} responsibility to support LICs, only a minority of 35\% of respondents support reparations (except in Italy where 56\% do), while 42\% oppose them (Figure~\ref{fig:reparations_support}). This suggests that framing global solidarity as a decolonial struggle might be counterproductive. % for its advocates. TODO? add for AER

\paragraph{Agreement That Own Taxes Should Solve Global Problems.}\label{par:my_tax}

% To crosscheck the findings and analyze the extent to which they could be affected by time, framing, or sampling, I reproduced a question asked in a previous study, the ``Global Solidarity Report'' \citep{global_nation_global_2023}. 
Overall, 41\% agree and 28\% disagree that ``[their] taxes should go towards solving global problem''. With 60\% relative agreement, there is a relative majority in favor of one's own taxes financing global solidarity, though a lower one than for specific proposals that would make the richest contribute.\footnote{This confirms that the willingness to pay for global solidarity, even through taxes, does not equate to acceptance of global redistribution proposals.%Mmeasure the same disposition as the support for global redistribution proposals. 
} 
As explained in Section \ref{sec:data} and shown in Appendix \ref{app:comparison}, the present results replicate well the ``Global Solidarity Report'' that first asked this question \citep{global_nation_global_2023}

% \paragraph{Comparison with existing surveys}

% To crosscheck the findings and analyze the extent to which they could be affected by time, framing, or sampling, I reproduced a question asked in a previous study, the ``Global Solidarity Report'' \citep{global_nation_global_2023}. Overall, 41\% agree and 28\% disagree that ``[Their] taxes should go towards solving global problem''. 
% The results replicate well the earlier study, as relative agreement, at 59\%, is just 3~p.p. higher in the present survey, and the cross-country correlation is .70 (see Figure \ref{fig:comparison} in Appendix \ref{app:comparison}). 

% Furthermore, although the question on the billionaire tax is not worded exactly as in \cite{cappelen_majority_2025}, the results are also very consistent, with an overall absolute support 4~p.p. lower in the present survey and a cross-country correlation of .86.

\paragraph{Moral Circle.}\label{par:group_defended}

Asked ``Which group of people do you advocate for when you vote?'',\footnote{In Russia and Saudi Arabia, the question was asked differently. It read: ``Which group do you advocate for? For example, if you were the richest person on Earth, which group would you predominantly help with your money?''\label{fn:group_defended}} 
45\% select a universalist answer (``Humans'' or ``Sentient beings (humans and animals)''), which is more than the most common answer, referring to one's fellow citizens (32\%). Universalists are fewer in Japan (30\%) %and the U.S. (43\%) 
but constitute a  majority in Europe (50\%) and Saudi Arabia (57\%), as shown in Figures \ref{fig:group_defended} and \ref{fig:group_defended_all}.
Among those who lean to the left, 59\% are universalists, compared to 32\% on the center-right or far-right. %, and 45\% of non-voters.

Following \cite{enke_universalism_2024}, I construct an alternative measure of universalism based on the vocabulary used in open-ended fields.\footnote{More specifically, I use the Moral Foundation Dictionary (MFD) 2.0 \citep{frimer_moral_2019} and define \textit{universalism} as the number of occurrences of \textit{care} or \textit{fairness} words minus the number of \textit{loyalty} or \textit{authority} words. I also test an alternative definition, based on the extended MFD \citep{hopp_extended_2021}, that uses weights rather than dummy variables to indicate a word's belonging to a moral dimension. The latter definition is even less (though still significantly) correlated with the latent support for global redistribution, at .03.} 
Although latent support for global redistribution is significantly correlated with this measure, the correlation is only .05, less than the correlation with manual, keyword, or AI classifications of a field as relating to inequality or poverty (at .09, .08, and .06, respectively), and much less than the correlation with our universalism variable based on moral circle (at .37). Furthermore, the correlation between the two measures of universalism is only .03. This observation demonstrates that the various indicators labeled as ``universalism'' by different authors may not all capture the same dimension.

\subsection{Preferred Channels for Transferring Resources to LICs}\label{subsec:transfer_how}

Asked to evaluate ways of transferring resources to reduce poverty in LICs on a 4-point Likert scale, the most preferred option in every country is ``Cash transfers to parents (child allowances), to the disabled and to the elderly'', with 16\% selecting it as the \textit{Best way} overall, and 49\% as a \textit{Right way} or \textit{Best way} (Figures \ref{fig:transfer_how}, \ref{fig:transfer_how_above_one}-\ref{fig:transfer_how_negative}). ``Unconditional transfers to the national government'' is the only option seen as a \textit{Wrong way} by the majority, but this share falls from 51\% down to 21\% (becoming the third most supported option out of seven) when ``transfers to the national government [are] conditioned on the use of funds for poverty reduction programs''. Interestingly, ``unconditional cash transfers to each household'' are controversial: they are the second most chosen \textit{Best way}, yet 33\% view them as a \textit{Wrong way}. Conversely, ``transfers to public development aid agencies which then finance suitable projects'' is uncontroversial, with only 16\% considering it a \textit{Wrong way}, while 37\% rate it as a \textit{Right} or \textit{Best way}.

\subsection{Custom Global Income Redistribution}\label{subsec:custom_redistr}

The last task of the questionnaire allowed respondents to manipulate the shape of the global income distribution.\footnote{Appendix \ref{subsec:country_features} details how I obtained the world distribution of PPP incomes. } The question text included the following instructions: 
\begin{quote}``Below you will find a graph of the world distribution of after-tax income and three sliders that vary it. The current distribution is in red, and your custom one is in green. The first two sliders control the proportion of winners and the proportion of losers, among all humans. The third slider controls the degree of redistribution from the richest to the poorest. 
If you do not want new policies to reduce global inequality, you can set the third slider to zero.''\end{quote} 
The interactive question is available at \href{https://www.centre-cired.fr/custom-global-redistr}{bit.ly/custom\_redistrib} and the algorithm translating slider positions into a redistribution is described in Appendix \ref{app:algo}. %and a video explainer on TODO.
Figure \ref{fig:custom_redistr_question} displays what respondents see below the instructions, including the interactive graph and a table summarizing how their custom redistribution would affect five example income levels (including their own, asked right before). To mitigate potential anchoring at the sliders' initial positions,%
\footnote{To test for anchoring, I regress responses on the sliders' initial positions. %The initial positions have a significant anchoring effect on the responses. %Relative to the other variant's %difference between the two variants'

I define the anchoring effect as the effect size relative to the difference between the initial positions of the two variants. It is always significant, at 36\% for the share of winners, 57\% for the share of losers, and 42\% for the degree of redistribution. While anchoring plays a role, the responses converge to a middle point between the two anchors, indicating that the anchors themselves may have been defined by the surveyor (myself) drifting away from a shared preference in opposite directions. % collective, common taste or natural focal point. 
} 
sliders are initialized in one of two random positions: %  (yielding similar rich-to-poor transfers of 4.3\% to 4.6\% of the world GDP)
either %the \textit{diffuse} redistribution with 
60\% of winners, 20\% of losers, and a degree of redistribution of 2 out of 10 (as in Figure \ref{fig:custom_redistr_question}); or %the \textit{concentrated} one with 
40\%, 10\%, and 7/10, respectively. 
Given the complexity of the task and its inconvenience on mobile devices, respondents are given the explicit option to skip it. 
% As the task is difficult to understand (and not so handy %to handle 
% on phone screens), respondents are instructed that they can skip it.

Overall, 56\% are satisfied with their custom redistribution and 43\% skip it.

% respondents who touched the sliders and are satisfied with their custom redistribution. 
Although the non-response rate may seem high, it is relatively evenly spread across the population. Indeed, the share of satisfied respondents is 52\% for non-voters, 54\% for center-right or right-wing voters, 57\% for far-right voters, and 61\% for left-wing voters; while it ranges from 49\% for people without a %secondary education (i.e.

Indeed, the share of conforming respondents is 37\% for non-voters, 39\% for center-right or right-wing voters, 40\% for far-right voters and 43\% for left-wing voters; while it ranges from 33\% for people without a high-school diploma to 42\% for those with a post-secondary diploma.  
The limited heterogeneity in response rates across crucial sociodemographic groups suggests that the task enabled motivated respondents to make an informed choice regarding their preferred redistribution with little sacrifice in terms of sample representativeness.

% \paragraph{Anchoring}
% Furthermore, the average responses are similar between satisfied and all respondents: between these groups, the share of winners and the degree of redistribution differ by at most 2\%, and the share of losers by at most 10\%. The similarity in results between satisfied respondents who moved the sliders and those who did not means that the average custom responses are similar to the average between the two possible sliders' initial positions. Two factors may explain this similarity. First, the responses might have been anchored at sliders' initial positions. Second, both the respondents and the surveyor (myself) might have a similar view of what a reasonable redistribution looks like. To test for anchoring, I regress responses on the sliders' initial position. The initial positions have a significant anchoring effect on the responses. %Relative to the other variant's %difference between the two variants' 
% % initial positions, a given variant brings the responses closer to its position by 
% The anchoring effect, defined as the effect size relative to the difference between the two variants' initial positions, is 
% 40\% for the share of winners, 55\% for the share of losers, and 42\% for the degree of redistribution. While anchoring plays a role, the responses converge to a middle point between the two anchors, indicating that the anchors themselves may have been defined by the surveyor drifting away (in opposite directions) from a shared preference. % collective, common taste or natural focal point. 

% To sum up, while this task enables respondents to make an informed choice regarding their preferred redistribution, it remains an imperfect method, and more appropriate ways to reveal citizens' preferred redistribution may be proposed. 

% With these caveats in mind, 
Figure \ref{fig:custom_redistr_median} shows the median preferred redistribution among satisfied respondents, i.e. the curve obtained by setting the sliders at their median preferred values: 49\% of winners, 18\% of losers, and a degree of redistribution of 5/10, resulting in a transfer of 5.4\% of world income from rich to poor and in a minimum income of \$287 per month. 
Interestingly, 48\% choose to lose from their custom redistribution while only 9\% choose to win; the median satisfied respondent selects parameters such that they neither win nor lose. Besides, 10\% of satisfied respondents opt for the status quo, preserving the current income distribution. 
Finally, Figure \ref{fig:custom_redistr_mean} presents the average preferred redistribution among satisfied respondents, obtained by pointwise averaging custom curves. 
The average preferred redistribution transfers 5.4\% of world income from the top 27\% to the bottom 73\% and entails a minimum income of \$247 per month.  
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:tax_radical_redistr}, at the top of the distribution, the average preferred redistribution can be achieved with a 7\% marginal income tax rate above \$25,000 and a 16\% rate above \$40,000 per year (at Purchasing Power Parity). 

Figures~\ref{fig:custom_redistr_satisfied_mean}-\ref{fig:custom_redistr_satisfied_median} reveal limited heterogeneity in custom redistributions across countries. However, Figures~\ref{fig:custom_redistr_winners_agg}-\ref{fig:custom_redistr_transfer_ceiling} show greater variation at the individual level, though the bulk of respondents favor a custom redistribution implying transfers of 4\% to 5\% of world income and a minimum income of \$150 to \$350 per month. 

\cite{fabre_french_2022} applied the same method to uncover French preferences regarding national income redistribution and tested support for the median and average % 42% losers in French average
preferred redistributions on a separate sample. Excluding the 22\% to 24\% of people not responding, 51\% of respondents accepted the average redistribution and 67\% the median one.%
\footnote{\cite{fabre_french_2022} also tested a redistribution obtained from median parameters and a 5\% lower aggregate income to account for adverse behavioral responses. This was accepted by 62\% of French respondents.} 
While one cannot be sure that these results would replicate in the context of a global redistribution, they suggest that a majority might accept the average or median redistribution described above.

\section{Conclusion} % Summary, conclusion

Applying the theory of optimal taxation, \cite{kopczuk_limitations_2005} show that the level of U.S. foreign aid could only be rationalized if the U.S. placed a value 2,000 times higher on the welfare of a US-American than on that of a foreigner (although this ratio should be reduced by the proportion of foreign aid transfers diverted or wasted). 
Our results contradict the notion that government action accurately reflects attitudes towards global redistribution and are consistent with a conservative bias among legislators \citep{gilens_testing_2014,broockman_bias_2018,pilet_politicians_2024}. 
Indeed, a majority of respondents in high-income countries support a global tax on top incomes to finance poverty reduction in low-income countries. Additionally, over two-thirds of respondents accept a tax on the wealth of millionaires with 30\% of the revenue financing LICs, even in the case of only a few countries implementing it. In every country, majorities accept an International Climate Scheme that is costly to them but beneficial to the poorest globally, showing that most people value climate action and poverty reduction. 

The revenue allocation task sheds light on how much people value global versus domestic public goods. On average, respondents allocate 17.5\% of the revenue from a hypothetical global wealth tax to sustainable development out of the five specified categories. 
This indicates that people are neither selfless universalists, who would allocate all the revenue from this tax to the poorest countries, nor devoid of altruism towards foreigners, as this would imply allocating nothing to global spending. 
The custom redistribution task confirms that most people would actually prefer much greater global redistribution than currently exists, as the average respondent opts for a global minimum income of \$247 per month, financed by transfers amounting to over 5\% of world income. 

An exploration of respondents' underlying values reveals that support for global redistribution primarily stems from a sense of duty and empathy towards the destitute. For some, this issue appears important enough to factor into their voting decision. Indeed, the likelihood that a political program is preferred increases if it includes a globally redistributive tax on millionaires and decreases if it includes cuts to foreign aid. Additionally, one-third of respondents report that they would be more likely to vote for a political party if it were part of a global movement for sustainable development, and a similar proportion state that they could themselves participate in such a movement. 

These results raise the question of why so few policymakers campaign on sustainable development proposals. The lack of supply of such campaigns might stem from pluralistic ignorance among policymakers and activists, consistent with the public's underestimation of support for a Global Climate Scheme. % as well as with previous studies \citep{}
Alternatively, it could be due to a lack of demand from constituents. Indeed, global inequality is rarely a top-of-mind consideration. People's most frequent concerns relate to self-interested issues such as their purchasing power or health; articulated political demands generally refer to national issues such as public services; and the most salient international issues are climate change, wars, and the rise of the far right. 

The low salience of global inequality may manifest as a lack of popular mobilization, resulting in it being a low priority for policymakers. Combined with the necessary trade-off between global redistribution and boosting fellow citizens' purchasing power, policymakers may prioritize the latter ---which is the primary concern of voters--- to the point of ignoring universalist attitudes. 
Status quo bias is a compounding factor: the weakness of global institutions and the primacy of national polities make international cooperation unlikely, % the lack of a worldwide polity 
which may discourage universalist thought and make it seem utopian. % mute the expression of universalist mindsets 
% Indeed, if people believed that global policies are likely, support for them would increase, as our information experiment demonstrated. 
Indeed, support for global policies is partly caused by the belief that they are likely, as our information experiment demonstrated. Therefore, the organization of the % solidarity confined at the national level 
world order based on nation-states might silence demands for % ``utopian''
universalist reforms and perpetuate a cycle where the low salience of universalist concerns and status quo institutions reinforce each other. 

Nevertheless, the survey results %widespread acceptance of sustainable development proposals 
suggest some untapped potential for global solidarity. It is unlikely that the public would resist global redistribution policies. This is especially true for balance sheet operations with expansionary impacts and indirect costs, such as debt restructuring, liquidity provision, %currency swaps, 
the expansion of lending by Multilateral Development Banks, and their recapitalization through the rechanneling of Special Drawing Rights. These reforms are widely accepted and are the natural focus of multilateral initiatives \citep{bridgetown_initiative_bridgetown_2025,ffd4_outcome_2025}. % Fair allocation of taxing rights, address illicit flows...
% Despite an unfavorable geopolitical context, the technicality of negotiations, and the (alleged or real) unreliability of institutions in recipient countries, multilateral initiatives such as the Sevilla Platform for Action \citep{ffd4_outcome_2025} make some (slow) progress on these issues. % institutional capacity % mismanagement of resources by 
% However, the current pace of progress is insufficient to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Our results suggest that accelerated progress would require increased salience of global inequality. 
% Inspired by the alleged role of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in making climate change salient, \cite{stiglitz_g20_2025} may have arrived at the same conclusion, when recommending to the G20 to establish an International Panel on Inequality.
Since public attitudes does not appear to be a limiting factor, further research is needed to understand policymakers' motivations and the obstacles they face in cooperating on sustainable development reforms. 

% Following the lead of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the salience of global inequality may be fostered by an International Panel on Inequality, as recommended at the G20 by \citep{stiglitz_g20_2025}.

% The paper utilizes two sets of surveys: the \textit{global} survey and the \textit{Western} surveys. The \textit{global} surveys consist of two U.S. surveys, \textit{US1} and \textit{US2}, and one European survey, \textit{Eu}. The \textit{global} survey was conducted from March 2021 to March 2022 on 40,680 respondents from 20 countries (with 1,465 to 2,488 respondents per country). \textit{US1} collected responses from 3,000 respondents between January and March 2023, while \textit{US2} gathered data from 2,000 respondents between March and April 2023. \textit{Eu} included 3,000 respondents and was conducted from February to March 2023. We used the survey companies \emph{Dynata} and \emph{Bilendi}. To ensure representative samples, we employed stratified quotas based on gender, age (5 brackets), income (4), region (4), education level (3), and ethnicity (3) for the U.S. We also incorporated survey weights throughout the analysis to account for any remaining imbalances. These weights were constructed using the quota variables as well as the degree of urbanization, and trimmed between 0.25 and 4. Stratified quotas followed by reweighting is the usual method to reduce selection bias from opt-in online panels, when better sampling methods (such as compulsory participation of random dwellings) are unavailable.\cite{scherpenzeel_how_2010} By applying weights, the results are fully representative of the respective countries along the above mentioned dimensions. %. 
% Appendix \ref{app:balance} shows that the treatment branches are balanced. Appendix \ref{app:placebo} runs placebo tests of the effects of each treatment on unrelated outcomes. We do not find effects of earlier treatments on unrelated outcomes arriving later in the survey. Appendix \ref{app:extended} shows that our results are unchanged when including inattentive respondents.
