Through an original survey on 12,000 respondents representative of eleven high-income countries (U.S., Japan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and seven European countries), I study the extent of support for global redistribution and climate policies, and their sensitivity to policy features such as the magnitude of the transfers or country coverage. Though not a salient concern, global inequality is seen as a big injustice. There is majority support for almost all global policies in almost all countries, including for policies that would redistribute 5\% of the world income, or that would be costly to the respondents.  % from the global top 3\% to the bottom 40\%. 
Global inequality is a vote-determining issue for many people; a political program is more likely to be preferred if it addresses it. Support for international policies decreases only slightly when the country coverage shrinks. These results confirm previous findings and suggest that a broad set of countries could work together for sustainable development.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}% NCCcomment

The development gap between the Global North and the Global South is at the heart of international relations, with the question of North-to-South transfers of resources and power 
at the forefront. This issue permeates negotiations in most areas, be it on debt restructuration, development assistance, tax cooperation, UN reform, or climate finance. % TODO footnote: (UN TC, UNFCCC-NCQG-Bridgetown, BEPS, (UN reform), foreign aid, debt relief, IMO, business class tickets)
In all international fora, Global South countries demand a more equal world order. Indeed, redirecting a mere 1\% of high-income countries' output to low-income countries (LICs) would mechanically double their national income. % TODO footnote 

Public attitudes in high-income countries (HICs) are key to understand whether globally redistributive policies would be politically feasible. 
Recent large-scale surveys reveal worldwide 
support for a globally coordinated tax on billionaires \citep{cappelen_majority_2025}, % TODO? remove from here as there is no international transfers in cappelen_majority_2025?
a democratic world government on global issues \citep{ghassim_who_2024}, climate action at the global (rather than national) level \citep{dechezlepretre_fighting_2025}, %increased foreign aid, 
as well as globally redistributive climate or tax policies \citep{fabre_majority_2025}. 
% Surveying the public in 40 countries, \cite{cappelen_majority_2025} document overwhelming support for a globally coordinated tax on billionaires, 

Despite strong stated support even in HICs, international redistribution is rarely discussed in public debates, let alone advocated % championed? embraced % 
by policymakers. % seldom embraced by policymakers or even activists in HICs. 
\cite{fabre_majority_2025} run survey experiments in the U.S. and four Western European countries to understand this mismatch, focusing on a ``Global Climate Scheme'' (GCS) costly to these countries. The authors reject hypotheses that the support for the GCS might be overstated: they find no social desirability bias in a list experiment, 6 out of 10 respondents prefer a political program that includes the GCS compared to one that does not, and most respondents are willing to sign a petition in favor of the GCS. % or may vanish in case of a negative media campaign. 
% TODO: more figures pro global redistr before instead of giving so prominently a counterargument here
While the authors find a support reduced by 11 percentage points (p.p.) following a (fictitious) negative media campaign --- an effect size similar to the actual decrease in support for the ``Green New Deal'' after it was publicly debated \citep{gustafson_development_2019} --- a campaign effect of this magnitude would not engender a majority opposition to policies supported by three-quarters of the population, such as a globally redistributive wealth tax. Therefore, \cite{fabre_majority_2025} conclude that support for global redistribution is genuine, %and their tests cannot fully explain why this topic is not more prominent in public debates. 
and another hypothesis is needed to explain the lack of prominence of this issue. A promising candidate is ``pluralistic ignorance'': the underestimation of public support. Indeed, pluralistic ignorance has been identified relative to the support for costly climate action \citep{andre_misperceived_2024,andre_globally_2024}, the billionaire tax \citep{cappelen_majority_2025}, and the GCS \citep{fabre_majority_2025}. 
Nevertheless, pluralistic ignorance has not prevented climate policies or a national wealth tax to enter public debates, suggesting that other mechanisms may be at play concerning global redistribution.

% Puzzle: majority support for global redistr yet seldom mentioned, let alone enacted; cite NHB, global>national for climate, Ghassim, Cappelen

In this paper, I conduct a pre-registered large-scale survey to test whether global redistribution policies are robustly supported and what can explain their lack of prominence. I test several hypotheses. Surveying eleven HICs, I test whether international policies garner majority support in countries seen as conservative and not yet surveyed on this topic, such as Japan, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Switzerland. As some key countries would probably not participate if tested policies were implemented, I test how support is affected when a climate scheme or a wealth tax is international but not truly global. I also test for pluralistic ignorance. I analyze the salience of global redistribution, and whether it is a vote-determining issue. I test for ``warm glow'', whereby people lure themselves into supporting a hypothetical policy in order to ease their conscience, notably by testing whether the support is claimed only for as long as the policy is deemed unlikely. Finally, I explore a variety of international policies, ranging from the plausible to the radical. % TODO: rewrite to problematize, see e.g. grant proposal
% Hypotheses: warm glow, salience, pluralistic ignorance, non-global or new countries

The results confirm earlier studies, as I find majority support in every country surveyed for almost all globally redistributive policies tested. Policies currently discussed in international negotiations are supported by large majorities. The most supported one is the 2\% tax on billionaire wealth proposed by \cite{zucman_blueprint_2024}, with 81\% relative support (in the pooled sample, among non-\textit{Indifferent} responses). Proposals such as debt relief for vulnerable countries, developed countries contributing 0.7\% of their GDP in foreign aid, an expansion of the UN Security Council, or the Bridgetown initiative (expanding sustainable investments at low interests rates in LICs) all garner at least 70\% relative support overall. 

Radical proposals are also largely accepted. In every country, there is majority agreement that ``governments should actively cooperate to have all countries converge in terms of GDP per capita by the end of the century'', and that globally coordinated climate policies are preferable to the status quo even if they entail a complete electrification of cars by 2045 as well as doubling prices on heating fuel, flights, and red meat. Overall, I find 64\% relative support for a progressive income tax that would collect 5\% of the world income from the global top~3\% to finance poverty reduction in the Global South, with tax rates ranging from 15\% above \$80,000 per year to 45\% above \$1 million. Relatedly, in an interactive task whereby the respondents can draw their preferred redistribution of global incomes, almost half of the respondents choose a redistribution that would make them poorer (\textit{versus} less than 10\% choosing one that would make them richer), and the average custom redistribution entails over 5\% of the world income in rich-to-poor transfers. 

% TODO: factor analysis => index pro global redistr => country ranking
While policies to address global inequality are well accepted, they have low salience. Indeed, this topic is seldom mentioned in open-ended fields at the beginning of the survey where respondents had to write about different considerations. The respondents' top concern is the cost of living and the most frequent wish is to have more purchasing power. While inequality is most often regarded as the greatest injustice, with some unconclusive indications that these answers relate to inequality at the global level, global inequality almost never appears among issue important to the respondents but neglected in the public debate. 

Before respondents could guess the survey's topic, they also had to complete a budget allocation task and a conjoint experiment. Asked to allocate the revenue from a %hypothetical 
global wealth tax between five spending items, 87\% of the respondents allocate a positive amount to the global item (public services in LICs). This item receives an average preferred share of 17.5\% of the revenue, slightly less than the equal split of 20\%. %This indicates that most people attach to sustainable development abroad a priority lower than for the average issue, but non-zero. 
This indicates that most people prioritise sustainable development abroad less than they do the average issue, but still consider it worthwhile. 

Despite its low salience, the conjoint experiment shows that global redistribution may be a vote-determining issue. In this task, respondents have to select their preference between two political programs, whose policies are selected at random from a pool of policies prominently debated in the country. When it appears in a program, a \textit{global tax on millionaires with 30\% of the revenue funding LICs} increases the likelihood that the program is preferred by 4~p.p., while \textit{cutting development aid} reduces it by 4~p.p. The finding that some voters might change their vote intention if a candidate campaigned on sustainable development is confirmed by a direct question, whereby 36\% of the respondents say they would be more likely (\textit{versus} 17\% less likely) to vote for a party if it is part of a global movement in favor of climate action, taxes on millionaires, and poverty reduction in LICs. In a related question, 68\% of the respondents (and 52\% of the 584 millionaires who answered) state they could actively support such a movement (either by signing a petition, demonstrating, going on strike, or donating to a strike fund). 

What if a sustainable development policy is international but not global? Support decreases only slightly. In the case of a wealth tax with 30\% of revenue financing LICs, the support is reduced from 74\% to 68\% when the policy is implemented only by some countries (e.g. the EU, the UK, and Brazil) rather than all countries. Likewise, in the case of an International Climate Scheme (ICS), defined as a cap-and-trade with equal per capita allocation of emissions rights, 
the support decreases from 69\% to 65\% when participating countries shrink from a set covering 72\% of world emissions to a coverage of 33\% of emissions.

I identify pluralistic ignorance through an incentivized question that asks respondents for their belief concerning to support for the Global (version of the) Climate Scheme, either among their compatriots or in the U.S. In eight countries, there is majority support for the GCS but most people believe there is not. Overall, the median respondent underestimates support in their own country by 15~p.p. and non-American respondents underestimate support in the U.S. by 24~p.p. Pluralistic ignorance may be an important driver behind the neglect of global solidarity solutions.

To test whether support might drop in case the prospect of global policies materializes, I manipulate the belief that large international transfers are likely in the next fifteen year. More specifically, I inform a random half of the respondents that ``countries have agreed to demonstrate some
degree of solidarity in addressing global challenges'', providing diverse examples including the recent adoption at the International Maritime Organization of a shipping levy that should partly finance LICs, the commitments of developed countries to finance climate action in developing countries, and the study % consideration? exploration?
by the G20 of a common tax on billionaires. The information treatment increases the belief that transfers are likely by 8~p.p. from a baseline of 35~\%, and significantly \textit{increases} the share of plausible global policies supported, by 1~p.p. An IV estimation shows that the share of policies supported causally increases by 15~p.p. when people believe that international transfers are likely, consistent with the non-causal effect estimated by OLS. In other words, I do not find any evidence of \textit{warm glow}. On the contrary, the effect goes in this opposite direction compared to the \textit{warm glow} hypothesis: when people believe that a global policy is likely, they accept it more (which can be interpreted as a \textit{status quo} bias). 

Finally, I test broad values of the respondents to check whether they are consistent with global redistribution. A majority of the respondents agree that ``helping countries in need in the right thing to do''. However, only a minority is convinced that it is in HICs' long-term interest to do so, or that it is their historical responsibility. Likewise, there is no majority support for reparations for colonization and slavery (except in Italy). This shows that the support for global solidarity is driven by a sense of empathy and duty, rather than guilt or interest. % TODO lire Cappelen 2025: pluralistic ignorance

Following the works of \cite{enke_moral_2020,cappelen_universalism_2025}, it is interesting to measure the degree of universalism. % TODO elaborate
I use a new question to measure universalism, asking the respondents what group they advocate for when they vote. 45\% choose a universalist answer (either ``Humans'' or ``Sentient beings (humans and animals)''), while 32\% choose their fellow citizens. Using a variance decomposition, I confirm the findings of \cite{enke_moral_2023} that universalism is a stronger explainer of policy attitudes than sociodemographic variables such as income, country or even vote. % TODO for them it's not better than vote
Consistent with the difference between countries in the other measures, the share of universalists is lower in Japan and the U.S., and highest in Saudia Arabia. % TODO: check Russia
In Europe, Saudi Arabia, as well as among left-wing voters, there is a majority of universalists. 
% Results: plausible as well as large changes accepted, low salience, lower-than-average but non-zero priority, vote-dermining (conjoint+movement), no warm glow, pluralistic ignorance, only slight decrease if non-global, duty main reason + linked to universalism

% TODO! Campaign effect; Acceptance rather than support; absence of global polity; trade-off purchasing power / global redistr; policymakers choose to go from lower priority to nothing. Given results, it seems very unlikely that plausible global redistr would be unpopular/resisted by the public: why not Bridgetown? debt relief? BEPS or ad tax? billionaire tax (reinvesting MNE profits into global public investments, Glennie - education among the highest rate of return)
% Why not more? next hypothesis: pluralistic ignorance of elites (Mildenberger & Tingley); national structures / representing nations bias diplomacy/thinking towards national interest (Buchholz for theoretical argument in climate negots, Schleich show 28-13% find their personal position well represented at these nego) (perhaps mix of zero-sum thinking (helping others will be bad for me) and nationalism)
% Robustness?

By studying in depth the support for global policies, this paper departs from the usual  %introduces a shift in the 
methodological approach of attitudinal surveys. In general, academic surveys focus on studying effect sizes of some treatment on political attitudes, or the socio-demographic factors that correlate with attitudes (e.g. \citealp{kuziemko_how_2015,douenne_yellow_2022,alesina_intergenerational_2018}). The magnitude of support for a given proposal is often regarded as unsuitable for satisfactory estimation, %as problematic to estimate satisfactorily. %
% It is often argued that 
because such attitudes are seen as weakly held, inconsistent, or unstable. 
The measure of support is usually left to non-academic pollsters, who rarely apply all the academic best practices: transparency, representative sampling, neutral and precise wording of questions, comparison with existing literature, use of multiple questions and complementary methods to correctly interpret the results. Although estimating the extent of support is challenging, this question seems too important not to be addressed using scientific methods. 
Moreover, \cite{ansolabehere_strength_2008} refutes common perceptions regarding policy attitudes, showing that they are largely stable and %this assess once measurement error has been reduced through the use of multiple measures, TODO: read ansolabehere_strength_2008
have as good an explanatory power on vote choice as party identification.  
% Furthermore, %absent large scale measurements of public opinion like referenda, 
% representative surveys remain the best method to assess support or opposition to given policies. 
In this paper, I inquire the support for various policies, approach the question from diverse angles, and run a battery of pre-registered tests to check whether stated support estimates are reliable.

% Another methodological novelty is the interactive...
% Method: interactivity, possibility to measure preferences

% Questions that do not prime global solidarity show that this topic is not a salient concern for most people, which may explain why global redistribution proposals receives little attention in public debate, despite widespread acceptance.

\section{Data and design\label{sec:data}}

\paragraph{Samples.}
I conducted an original survey on 12,007 respondents representative of the adult population in eleven high-income countries (see Figure \ref{fig:country_coverage}). The countries have been chosen to span the diversity of high-income countries and the sample sizes to be commensurate to these countries' population sizes.\footnote{The sample sizes are as follows: U.S.: 3,000; Japan: 2,000; Russia: 1,007; Saudi Arabia: 1,000; Europe: 5,000, split in proportion to the countries' adult population size (except for Switzerland), that is France: 798; Germany: 1,048; Italy: 756; Spain: 603; Poland: 500; Switzerland: 469.} % TODO margin of error
The survey was fielded online in 2025 using the companies \textit{Yandex} (for Russia), \textit{Kantar} (for Saudi Arabia), and \textit{Bilendi} (for the other countries).\footnote{For all countries but Russia, responses were collected between April 15 and July 3, 2025. For Russia, responses were collected between September 19 and October 9, 2025. Each complete response is rewarded around \euro{}3 in gift points.} 

In Russia, the questionnaire was curtailed as I could not ask the same questionnaire as in the other countries, for two reasons. First, I could not use the platform \textit{Qualtrics}, which prevented me from asking some question formats (such as constant sum scales) or from embedding Javascript (used to design an interactive question). Second, I had to cut or reword some questions due to preventive censorship by the survey company. In the other countries, the questionnaires are almost identical, though the figures in questions are adapted to the country context (e.g. when informing about the cost of the Global Climate Scheme to the average person of the country). Appendix \ref{app:specificities} lists the specificities of the questionnaire in each country.

% # 1? coverage map

    }\label{fig:country_coverage}
    \makebox[\textwidth][c]{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/maps_participation/country_coverage_curtailed.png}} 
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Representativeness.}
The samples are stratified to be representative of the country's adult population along the following quota variables (with some exceptions\footnote{In the U.S., I also use race (4 categories) as a quota variable. In Saudi Arabia, I do not use urbanicity, but I use citizenship (Saudi vs. non-Saudi). In Russia, I do not use region nor urbanicity.}): gender, age (5 brackets), income (4), diploma (3), region (2 to 5), and urbanicity (2 to 3). Tables \ref{tab:representativeness_0}-\ref{tab:representativeness_3} in Appendix \ref{app:representativeness} show that our samples match the actual population frequencies along these dimensions, except for Saudi Arabia (where non-Saudis and non-high-school-educated people are underrepresented) and Russia (where TODO!). All our results are reweighted to be fully representative of the population along our quotas (with weights trimmed between 0.25 and 4). Results aggregated at the global or European levels weigh each country in proportion to its adult population size. 

% TODO! group_defended explain largest share of variance, more than country or vote, cf. Enke et al. 23
Appendix Figure \ref{fig:lmg} shows that 11\% to 17\% of the variance of our main attitudinal outcomes is explained by sociodemographic variables, and this share falls below 5\% after accounting for country and vote. In other words, even though variables such as age or diploma are sometimes significantly correlated with attitudes (see Tables \ref{tab:determinant}-\ref{tab:determinants_custom_redistr}), difference in average acceptance of a policy between (say) age groups rarely exceeds a dozen percentage points. % TODO? move to subsec:debated ?

Appendix \ref{app:pol} shows how our main attitudinal outcomes vary by political leaning. Non-voters exhibit attitudes close to the center of the politicalspectrum. Besides, attitudes are much less polarized in Japan compared to Europe and the U.S. % TODO: has polarization decreased since last paper?
Appendix Figures \ref{fig:vote_pnr_out}-\ref{fig:vote_representativeness} show how our % weighted or not TODO 
samples compare to reality in terms of vote in the last election. While the share of declared non-voters is lower than in reality, votes along the three main political leanings are close to reality. Appendix \ref{app:vote} shows that our main results are robust to reweighting by vote. 

\paragraph{Data quality.} 
The median survey duration is 17 minutes (13 min in Russia). % Following TODO cite Stantcheva
Best practices have been used to ensure top-notch data quality. 
The questionnaire has been worded in a neutral and informative way;\footnote{At the end of the survey, 70\% of the respondents find it politically unbiased (Appendix Figure \ref{fig:survey_biased}).} tested on random people in public spaces to make sure it is correctly understood; translated by professional translators, with figures converted into national currencies, and double-checked by native speakers.

Of all respondents who started the questionnaire, only TODO! \% dropped out. TODO respondents were allowed to pursue the survey (as their quotas were not full) and did not drop out.  The final sample is obtained after excluding of this extended sample TODO \% of respondents for suspicion of low quality: \% for failing an attention test and \% for answering the questionnaire in less than 6 min (including \% for both reasons). Appendix \ref{app:attrition} checks for differential attrition and Appendix \ref{app:extended} shows that our main results replicate on the extended sample. 
% TODO: feedback field

Whenever possible, the order of question items is randomized. Appendix \ref{app:order} studies the effect of item order on answers. The item order generally has a significant but small effect (2 to 10~p.p.). The size of the effect help identify questions for which opinions are strongly held (e.g. the preference of a sustainable scenario over the status quo) \textit{versus} weakly held (e.g. the preferred amount of climate finance). % crystallized, well-formed, consolidated, stable, ambivalent

Appendix \ref{app:comparison} compares the answers of two attitudinal questions asked in other surveys: the overall averages differ by 2 to 4~p.p. and their cross-country correlation is high: .70 \citep{global_nation_global_2023} to .86 \citep{cappelen_majority_2025}. 

\paragraph{Incentives.}
The questionnaire includes three incentivized questions, each awarded with a \$100 prize for one randomly drawn winner. First, a comprehension question on the Global Climate Scheme (GCS) checks whether respondents have understood the policy's cost. % TODO: support among those who haven't understood
Second, a donation lottery where respondents choose what part of the prize they would donate to a reforestation NGO, should they win the lottery. Third, a question on the perception of the actual support for the GCS, which rewards a correct guess.

\paragraph{Survey structure.}
While Appendix \ref{app:questionnaire} provides the full questionnaire, Figure \ref{fig:flow} depicts the survey flow with all random branches. The various treatments are all independent and uniformly distributed. Whenever there is a treatment, the acceptance levels reported are computed on the control group. Appendix \ref{app:placebo} runs placebo tests to check whether earlier treatments have an effect on unrelated outcomes.

    \makebox[\textwidth][c]{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/questionnaire/survey_flow.pdf}} 
\end{figure}

After sociodemographic characteristics, the questionnaire starts with broad questions to grasp the prioritization and salience of global solidarity before the respondents can understand the survey's topic. First, open-ended fields on either their main concerns, wants, issues of interest, or perceived injustices. Second, a conjoint experiment where respondents have to select their preferred political program, or abstain. Both programs are random: each policy (or absence of policy) in five policy domains is taken at random from a pool of policies prominent in the country's public debate. Third, respondents are asked to allocate the revenue of a global wealth tax between five (national or global) spending items. 

Then come attitudinal questions on the main policies studied: a \textit{Climate Scheme} at the national, global, or international level; an international wealth tax funding low-income countries; and ten plausible global solidarity policies. These questions include treatments that vary the international coverage of policies or test for warm glow. 

The last part of the questionnaire explores attitudes towards more radical global redistribution scenarios and include more sophisticated questions, such as an interactive task where respondents can choose their preferred custom redistribution of global incomes by manipulating sliders. 

Finally, the survey concludes with a comprehension question, synthetic questions (e.g. on moral circle) and a feedback field.

In this Section, I analyze the salience of global solidarity in undirected open-ended fields; and the prioritization of global programs in a budget allocation task.

\subsection{Top-of-mind considerations}\label{subsec:considerations}

At the beginning of the survey, respondents are randomly assigned one open-ended question among four: their main concerns, their needs or wishes, an issue important to them but neglected in public debate, or the greatest injustice of all. The questions are deliberately broad and vague to let respondents express their top-of-mind considerations without any priming. 

To analyze the answers, I automatically translated each field into English.\footnote{I used \href{https://www.onlinedoctranslator.com/en/translationform}{onlinedoctranslator.com}, which is powered by \textit{Google Translate}.} Then, I used AI and my own reading of a few hundreds answers to identify the most common concepts, from which I selected 27 categories. Then, I classified each answer into one or more of these categories, both manually (Figures \ref{fig:field_manual}-\ref{fig:injustice_field}) and automatically using AI (Figure \ref{fig:field_gpt}). Finally, I manually defined a list of 47 (conjunction of) keywords and used it to automatically classify all answers.\footnote{The list of keywords is given in Appendix TODO!.} I report occurrences of the 24 most common keyword matches in Figure \ref{fig:field_keyword}. 

The three different classification methods yield consistent results but differ in accuracy. While the keyword classification allows an exact and reproducible search, the automatic search is not bound to specific words and captures more matching responses. % Although the manual classification could be less consistent than the AI one (if e.g. the interpretation of the category changes over time or among coders), 
Overall, it seems that the manual classification provides the most accurate results, with a number of matches generally between the two other methods. 
For example, to the \textit{injustice} question, 1.3\% of answers match the keywords for \textit{global inequality} and ChatGPT identifies this category in 8.5\% of answers, \textit{versus} 3.7\% according to my manual coding.\footnote{The keyword matching searches the regular expression ``global poverty|global inequal|hunger|drinking water|starv'', ignoring case. The automatic and manual classification is based on the class definition ``Inequality at the inetrnational level / Hunger or poverty in poor countries''.} 
Indeed, the AI incorrectly classifies unspecific answers like ``poverty'' in this category,\footnote{Interestingly, out of the 45 (one-word) answers ``poverty'', ChatGPT-4.1 coded only 42 of them as \textit{global inequality}, showing the lack of consistency of this classifier.} while the keyword search misses answers like ``inequality among humans''. 
Given this observation, I use the manual classification as the benchmark and the two other methods as robustness checks.

While less accurate than the classifications, wordclouds (Figure \ref{fig:wordcloud}) provide a simple visualization of the most common concepts in each question. By far, the most frequent \textit{concerns} or \textit{wishes} of respondents relate to their purchasing power, with concepts such as ``money'', ``inflation'', the ``cost of living'', or ``financial stability'' mobilized in 30\% of these fields. Within country, the share of people concerned with money decreases with income: it ranges from 21\% in the top income decile to 36\% in the bottom one. % TODO define e$gdp_pc_ppp and cor money
The next most frequent \textit{concerns} are health (or the healthcare system), far right governments (or related concepts such as ``Trump'' or ``trade tariffs''), and war (either in general or a specific one such as the Gaza war). Most \textit{wishes} are personal, with the next frequent ones related to the health or peace of mind of oneself or one's relatives. Interestingly, almost none of the responses mention relational considerations such as love, friendships, loneliness, intimate life, or the desire to have children (except for Saudi Arabia for the latter). Further research is needed to test whether the predominance of materialistic considerations stems from the context (an impersonal survey) or truly reflects people's primary thoughts.

\end{figure}

Asked about the greatest \textit{injustice}, the most frequent answers relate to ``inequality'' or ``poverty'', with 19\% of occurrences (28\% in Europe but only 9\% in the U.S.). It is unclear whether these respondents think about inequality in their own country or at the global level, as only 13\% of them mention a geographical scope. A hint is that 2\% mention their own country \textit{versus} 11\% the global level (or Global South issues such as ``clean water'' or ``starvation''), with Italians and Poles the most prone to mention the global level and Japanese the least. The next most common answers relate to ``discrimination'' (based on gender, race, or sexual orientation), ``violence'' or ``wrongful convictions'' (many respondents denounce unjustly sentenced innocents), or their country's ``welfare State'' (with people either criticizing the lack of public services or excessive welfare for underserving people). 

Asking people for ``an issue important to them but neglected in the public debate'' fails to uncover unusual topics. 20\% of respondents are not able to find such an issue. Although ``immigration'' is the most frequent word according to the wordcloud, only 5\% of respondents refer to this issue, which comes after ``public services'', the ``cost of living'', or the ``environment''. That most topics mentioned are already highly publicized suggests that the public debate either reflects or shapes what people have in mind. % ``taxes'' or the ``welfare State'' (12\%), the ``healthcare system'' (9\%), the ``cost of living'' (9\%), and the ``environment'' (6\%).

Reading and coding each field one by one took about 30 hours, but it was worth it: not only does it result in an arguably more accurate classification; it also helped me grasp people's ways of thinking first hand. For example, most people reason from their own perspective (e.g. ``my pension is too low'', ``I want to buy a house'') and do not refer to the broader picture or to political reforms. To get a sense of people's own words, a random display of responses can be found on \href{http://preferences-pol.fr/fields2025.html}{bit.ly/fields2025}.

To sum up, the low salience of global solidarity may explain why this topic fails to mobilize political forces despite it being referred to as a just cause and it being accepted by majorities (as shown below). 

\subsection{Prioritization of public spending items}\label{subsec:revenue_split}

\cite{fabre_majority_2025} finds that 58\% of US-Americans and 71\% of Western Europeans would support a global tax on millionaires funding low-income countries (LICs), with only 26\% and 14\% opposing it; that around half of them would prefer to allocate half (rather than none) of the revenue from a global wealth tax to LICs; and that, on average, respondents prefer to allocate 33.4\% of such revenue to LICs (\textit{versus} domestic healthcare and education). 
% \cite{fabre_majority_2025} uses two random variants to study the preferred use of revenue from a global wealth tax between infrastructure and public services \textit{in
% low-income countries} \textit{versus} \textit{domestic} healthcare and education. The ``binary'' variant shows that around half of US-Americans and Western Europeans prefer to allocate half (rather than none) of the revenue to low-income countries. The ``continuous'' variant shows that the median respondent prefers to allocate 30\% of the revenue to low-income countries (LICs).
In other words, while most people would prefer a globally redistributive tax to the status quo, the more leeway they are granted to allocate the revenue from such a tax, the less they would allocate to LICs. The greatest leeway tested by \cite{fabre_majority_2025} let the respondents select their preferred share for LICs \textit{versus} one alternative spending item, and the average preference was 33.4\%, that is 67\% of an equal split. % \footnote{The greatest leeway possible would be an open-ended field, but its interpretation would be challenging as answers that do not specify the geographical scope would be equivocal.}
Naturally, one expects respondents to split the revenue between all desirable spending items, so that the revenue allocated to one item depends on the number of items. Therefore, if LICs compete with not one but several national items, the share allocated to LICs is expected to diminish. If this share is less than 67\% of the equal split, it would mean that \citep{fabre_majority_2025} overestimated the prioritization of LICs, e.g. or due to an excessive salience of LICs when only one alternative is proposed, or due to the domestic alternative --healthcare and education-- not being the most desired. Conversely, if several items relate to a global issue, the total of ``global spending'' should increase. If global spending increases by less than the proportionate amount for the number of global items, it could mean that people view global items as a single entity, but that some domestic issues were missing from the binary version.

To test whether results from \citep{fabre_majority_2025} gave an accurate picture of the % relative
prioritization of global spending as well as to uncover the prioritization of different global causes, I conduct a revenue allocation task with five spending items. 
In each of the two variants of this task, respondents use sliders to allocate the revenue of a fictive global tax of wealth (in excess of \$5 million, at a rate of 2\%), after being informed of the revenue the tax would collect in their country (from \$1 billion in Poland to \$514 in the U.S.) \textit{versus} in all LICs combined (\$1 billion). 

In the variant \textit{Few}, one global item (``Education, Healthcare and Renewable energy in LICs'') competes with four domestic ones. %(``Education and healthcare'', ``Social welfare programs'', ``Reduction in the income tax'', ``Reduction of the deficit''). 
In every country, the most prioritized item is ``Domestic: Education and healthcare'', with an average preferred share of 26\% (Figures \ref{fig:split_few_bars_nb0}, \ref{fig:split_few}). The global item is the least prioritized overall, at 17.5\% (from 14\% in Japan to 21\% in Saudia Arabia and Spain). However, global spending is the second most prioritized item in Europe (19\%) and Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, global spending is 31\% higher than the expected 13.4\% (that is 66.8\% of % an equal split of % TODO!! stat test
20\%)\footnote{If one restricts the comparison to the countries surveyed by \citep{fabre_majority_2025}, the global item is allocated 17.8\%, that is 34\% more than expected. The most credible explanation for outperforming expectations is that the domestic item chosen by \citep{fabre_majority_2025} was the preferred one. Indeed, the global item is allocated 68\% of the ``Domestic: Healthcare and Education'' share, almost exactly as expected.} and only 13\% of the respondents do not allocate any revenue to it (Figure \ref{fig:split}). 

%While these results reveal large acceptance of allocating a substantial share of the revenue from a global tax to LICs, this may result from framing the question with only two spending items (domestic \textit{versus} LICs).

In the variant \textit{Many}, five items are selected at random among a pool of four global and nine domestic items. While domestic healthcare (27\%) %(27.0\%) 
and education (23\%) %(22.5\%) 
are the most prioritized items, global ones obtain an average ranging from 17\% %16.5\% 
for ``Forestation and biodiversity projects'' to 19\% %18.6\% 
for ``Education and Healthcare in LICs'' (Figures \ref{fig:split}, \ref{fig:split_many}-\ref{fig:split_many_global_mean}). On average, there are 1.5 global items and they are allocated 26.9\% of the revenue, which again corresponds to 17.5\% per global item. Interestingly, there is no significant correlation between the number of global items and the average allocation per global item. % TODO table
% TODO! Russia

In other words, the revenue allocation tasks validate and confirm the results from \citep{fabre_majority_2025}. Most people would like to use a substantial share of the revenue from a global wealth tax to financing sustainable development in LICs, even though global spending is somewhat less prioritized than domestic spending. 


\section{Acceptance of international policies in function of country coverage\label{sec:coverage}}
% - Strong support for global tax / GCS even with partial participation

While acceptance of global climate or redistributive policies is widespread \citep{fabre_majority_2025,cappelen_majority_2025}, acceptance may drop if policies are not truly \textit{global} but only \textit{international}, i.e. if key countries such as China, Russia or the U.S. do not participate. Indeed, people may be concerned by a domestic loss of competitiveness that could result from the expatriation of taxpayers to low-tax jurisdictions; or by an unfair burden-sharing if non-cooperating countries free-ride on decarbonization or funding sustainable development. % TODO: cite Gampfer, Carlsson, Bechtel Scheve 2013 May also depend on which countries are in
In this Section, I uncover the acceptance of globally redistributive policies depending on the coalition of countries that would implement them. I study in turn a carbon price and a wealth tax.

\subsection{International Climate Scheme}\label{subsec:ics}

% TODO: cite Beiser-McGrath \& Bernauer (2019), Sivonen (2022): +15pp if all countries rather than just half in CN, US
% NB: I chose to present GCS on control. Trade-off between presenting control results (not contaminated by treatment though less precise) and overall results (more comparable to ICS as those mix treated and control, though less comparable to NCS). I prioritized presenting results for themselves rather than for comparison with ICS.

\paragraph{Presentation of the schemes.} ``Cap and dividend'' is a reference climate policy, % TODO cite
whereby fossil fuel companies at the source of emissions must buy emission permits on a carbon market, with the revenue from carbon pricing rebated equally to individuals. The limited and declining number of emission permits guarantees that emissions are capped according to the climate objective. As polluting companies pass the cost of emission permits down the value chain, the carbon price is ultimately paid by consumers, in proportion to their carbon footprint. Meanwhile, the equal cash transfer (or ``dividend'') offsets price increases for the average consumer. Those with a carbon footprint higher than average financially lose and those with a lower carbon footprint (who are on average poorer) financially gain. 
% explanation cap & dividend

Using simple \textit{Yes}/\textit{No} questions, I test the acceptance of three types of ``cap and dividend'' (or ``Climate Scheme'') policies, that differ by the geographical scope: the National, Global, and International Climate Schemes (Figures \ref{fig:ics}, \ref{fig:ncs_gcs_ics}). While average consumers in a high-income country are financially unaffected by the National Climate Scheme (NCS), they lose out in the Global and International versions, since their carbon footprint is larger that the world (or climate coalition) average. 

The National Climate Scheme (NCS) is accepted by 66\% of respondents (ranging from 56\% in Poland to 88\% in Saudi Arabia). 
% majority support NCS (TODO? cite Douenne & Fabre? Bergquist?)
% TODO? say asked only to one-third?

\paragraph{The Global Climate Scheme.} Before presenting the Global Climate Scheme (GCS), respondents are prompted to be attentive with the incentive that they may win a \$100 lottery prize if they correctly answer a comprehension question at the end of the survey. 
When presented the Global Climate Scheme (GCS), respondents are informed that the cash transfer would lift 600~million people out of extreme poverty, and the cost to them is made salient. Respondents are informed of the amount of the cash transfer, as well as the price increases and the net cost to the average person in their country (e.g. 2\% price increases and a net cost of \$90 per month in the U.S., or 2\% and \euro{}45 per month in Germany).%
\footnote{The computations use a carbon price of \$95/tCO$_\text{2}$. For Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the U.S., computations assume universal country coverage and the cash transfer is \$35 per month. 
For Europe and Japan, the net loss is computed in a non-universal but \textit{High} participation scenario, which implies a lower cash transfer (\euro{}20 per month) and a higher net cost (by about \$10 per month) since the coalition's average carbon footprint is lower than the world average.} 
The GCS is accepted by 57\% of respondents (from 48\% in Russia to 85\% in Saudi Arabia). The salience of costs in the GCS question may explain the somewhat lower support for the GCS compared to the NCS.%
\footnote{Support for the GCS is also around 10~p.p. lower than in \citep{fabre_majority_2025}. There may be different reasons for that: attitudes may have changed in the two years interval; I added the information on the price increases, which allows respondents to make an estimate of the cost to them (rather than to their average fellow citizen)%; and the framing might have been slightly confusing in the earlier survey as the GCS was presented on the same page as a national redistribution scheme TODO? put back? 100 countries instead of 60%?

After the support for the GCS, respondents are asked in an incentivized way about their belief concerning the actual support, either in their country or in the U.S. (Figure \ref{fig:ncs_gcs_ics})\footnote{US-Americans are asked about either their country or the EU. In Russia, I was not allowed to enquire about beliefs in a foreign country.} In every country, for any variant of the question, actual support is underestimated. On average, the support in one's own country is underestimated by 14~p.p. and the support in the U.S. by 18~p.p. In Japan and in European countries, the underestimation is more severe, in the sense that most people wrongly believe that the GCS does not garner majority support in their country. Such pluralistic ignorance might explain why politicians do not dare proposing global climate justice policies. % TODO? cite Andre et al? Conservative bias (Brookman & Skovron; Pilet et al)?

\paragraph{International Climate Scheme.}
To test how country coverage influences the support for the International Climate Scheme (ICS), respondents are randomly assigned to one of four variants. Respondents can visualize the country coverage on a map (see examples in Figure \ref{fig:ics_maps}), where their own country is stripped to denote its potential participation. They are also informed of the number of countries that would participate in the assigned scenario, their share of world emissions, and the list of these countries or world regions.

The \textit{Mid} scenario covers 56\% of world emissions, with the participation of China and Global South countries. The \textit{Low} replaces China by the EU and covers 33\% of emissions. The \textit{High scenario} adds various high-income countries to the \textit{Mid} scenario, including the EU, Japan, Canada, and South Korea; covering 72\% of emissions. The last variant, \textit{High color}, combines the \textit{High} participation scenario with a colored map that displays not only the country coverage, but also the net gain or cost for each country, with China appearing as neither gaining nor losing from the policy.\footnote{In a standard cap and dividend, China should be losing, as its carbon footprint is larger than the world average. However, the Global Climate Scheme slightly departs from the standard policy so that middle-income countries do not lose out \citep{fabre_global_2025}.}

% TODO say base support
As expected, the wider the coverage, the higher the support. However, this effect is relatively small, as the support is only 4~p.p. higher in the \textit{High} compared to the \textit{Low} variant. Interestingly, among Europeans, the support significantly increases when China is added to coalition, but not significantly more when other HICs are also added. Conversely, for US-Americans and Japanese, the participation of the EU or China yield similar levels of support, and only the combined participation of China, the EU, and other HICs significantly increase the support. 

The support is 6.5~p.p. lower in the \textit{High color} compared to the \textit{High} variant. Three reasons may explain this effect. First, some respondents may be concerned by the information (made explicit in the question) that China would neither gain nor lose from the policy. 
Second, with the colored map, respondents learn how their own country fares compared to other countries. Actually, the effect is 1~p.p. and no longer significant for countries that appear to lose less than 0.5\% of their GDP (Spain and Switzerland). Third, the cost may be more salient with the colored map. Interestingly, the support for the GCS is 5~p.p. lower for the 74\% of respondents who understand that it would result in increased gasoline prices (after controlling for sociodemographics), but this effect is only 2~p.p. and no longer significant for the \textit{High color} ICS, indicating that the information provided by the map mostly affects those who had not yet understood the policy's consequences. 

Notice that the support for the ICS's \textit{Low} coverage is similar to that for the NCS. This suggests that the average respondent is willing to pay the ICS's higher cost for the guarantee of poverty alleviation and decarbonization in the Global South. %This suggests that, for the average person, the guarantee of poverty alleviation and decarbonization in the Global South balances out the ICS's higher cost. 
Finally, the greater support for the ICS compared to the GCS is somewhat puzzling. Perhaps, people view the proposal as more credible when a list of countries is provided, compared to the GCS that is framed as if all countries might join (or on the contrary, in which the participation of any country is uncertain). Relatedly, support may be stronger for more precise or more visual proposals, either because they are viewed as more advanced or because they induce an experimenter demand bias. The greater support could also be due to costs being less salient in the ICS question (but the support is still greater than in the GCS in the \textit{High color} variant, where costs are visible). Unfortunately, the data does not allow testing these different hypotheses.

% support increases with coverage
% ICS low: similar to NCS: people willing to pay Global South for its decarbonization

\subsection{Wealth tax funding LICs}\label{subsec:wealth_tax}

I test the effect of country coverage on the support for an internationally redistributive wealth tax using a simple \textit{Yes}/\textit{No} question with three random variants. The policy is described as a 2\% tax on wealth above \$1~million, with 30\% of its revenue financing public services in LICs. In the \textit{Global} variant, all other countries (i.e. all countries except the respondent's one) are assumed to participate. The \textit{HIC} variant covers all other HICs. The \textit{International} variant covers some countries and not others, with the precise coverage varying by respondent's country but always including Brazil and European countries (or the whole EU) and excluding China and the U.S.\footnote{More precisely, in the U.S., excluded countries differ and are China, Japan, and Canada. As for included countries, on top of Brazil, they are: the EU and the UK for Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, and the U.S.; the EU for Russia and the UK; and France, Germany, Spain, and the UK (except one's own country) for EU countries.}

Here again, the support increases with the country coverage, but the effect is small. The middle-ground \textit{HIC} variant garners 70\% support (from 58\% in Switzerland to 81\% in Saudi Arabia). Compared to \textit{HIC}, the support is 5~p.p. higher in the \textit{Global} coverage, while it is only 1.5~p.p. and non-significantly lower in the \textit{International} coverage (Figure \ref{fig:wealth_tax}).

\section{Sincerity of support for global redistribution\label{sec:sincerity}}

Skeptics about the public's support for global redistribution would argue that the support is not reflected in real-stake decisions and that it mostly results from \textit{warm glow}. According to the \textit{warm glow} hypothesis, many people would express their support to enjoy moral comfort as long as public support seems harmless since the policy appears out of reach, but support would vanish if (\textit{i}) the prospect of implementation materialized or if (\textit{ii}) moral comfort could be obtained from a substitute. In this Section, I test whether global redistribution is a vote-determining issue using a conjoint analysis, and I test both forms of \textit{warm glow} (\textit{i} and \textit{ii}) using two other survey experiments.
% - No (or little) evidence of warm glow or support due to unrealism; global redistr genuinely supported (conjoint analysis)

\subsection{Conjoint analysis}\label{subsec:conjoint}

I run a conjoint experiment in all countries except Russia and Saudi Arabia. This question is positioned at the beginning of the survey, before respondents can know the survey's topic. Respondents are presented with two random political programs, framed as the fictive programs of the top candidates in the next election, and asked which of the candidate they would vote for (27\% of the respondents choose the outside option \textit{Neither of them}). Each program contains a policy or an absence of policy chosen at random for each of five policy domains (the order of which is also randomized). %: \textit{Economic issues}, \textit{Social issues}, \textit{Climate policy}, \textit{Tax system}, \textit{Foreign policy}. 
Our domain of interest is \textit{Foreign policy}, whose pool contains three policies: \textit{Cut development aid}, \textit{International tax on millionaires with 30\% financing healthcare and education in low-income countries}, and a country-specific policy. % (e.g. \textit{Support Ukraine militarily and financially} in Germany). 
I included both a \textit{pro}- and an \textit{anti}-global redistribution policy to capture a potential status quo bias, or on the contrary, a bias in favor of (any) reform. 
Except for these two policies of interest, the policies have been selected from the programs of the main candidates in the country's last election, so as to span the entire political spectrum and cover the most prominent proposals in the country's public debate. 

Figure \ref{fig:conjoint} shows the effect of our policies of interest's presence in a program on the likelihood that it is preferred (see Figures \ref{fig:conjoint_FR}-\ref{fig:conjoint_ES_original} for full results country-by-country\footnote{With some exceptions, raising the minimum wage is among the most popular policies, together with redistributive taxes or transfers, anti-immigration regulations, and abortion rights. % TODO study party of most/least popular policies by country
Conversely, a ban on new combustion-engine cars is among the least popular ones.}). 
% TODO! why Japan millionaire significant in conjoint_JP but not in conjoint?
More specifically, Figure \ref{fig:conjoint} presents the results %estimates of coefficients $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ 
of the following regression estimated by simple OLS, with standard errors clustered by respondent: 
$$\text{Preferred}_{pi} = \beta_1 \text{Cut\_aid}_{pi} + \beta_2 \text{Intl\_tax}_{pi} + \beta_3 \text{Foreign3}_{pi} + \varepsilon_{pi}$$
where $pi$ denotes either program $p$ faced by respondent $i$, and each variable is a dummy.

\end{figure}

Both policies significantly affects the program choice: the internationally redistributive millionaire tax increases by 4~p.p. the likelihood that a program is preferred, while cutting development aid decreases it by 4~p.p. On a single country, the effects are generally non-significant due to lack of power, but when significant, they are of the same sign as the global effect, except for \textit{Cut aid} in Switzerland. Overall, the effects are of comparable size to the effects of other policies, % TODO justify
suggesting that global redistribution issues may be as vote-determining as policies prominent in the national debate. 

One concern with this type of conjoint analysis is that they involve unrealistic political programs, namely programs that contain both left and far right policies, which distorts the real choice that voters may face. \cite{cuesta_improving_2022} showed that to fully address this issue, one should weigh each pair of programs by the probability that such a pair would be proposed in a real election. As such probability cannot be computed, the best practice is to bound the effects by estimating them with extreme probabilities. The results just presented are based one extreme, the uniform distribution. To construct the other extreme, I classify each policy as left, center, or right, and assume that a program is consistent if it does not contain policies from both the left and the right. I then re-estimate the regression after dropping all pairs an inconsistant program (effectively assigning a probability of zero to them). I first classify our policies of interest as \textit{center} (considering them as consistent with any program), in which case 59\% of observations are retained, and effects are preserved. This indicates that our results are robust to the critique of \cite{cuesta_improving_2022}. Interestingly, the effects differ when I classify our policies of interest as \textit{left} (for the tax) and \textit{right} (for cutting aid), in which case only 39\% of observations are retained. In that case, the effect of the millionaire tax is preserved, but the effect of cutting aid vanishes to 0~p.p. In other words, the effect of cutting aid disappears when removing left-leaning programs where it is present, while the effect of the tax remains the same when removing right-leaning programs where it is present. Therefore, cutting aid is harmful only for left-leaning programs, while a wealth tax is helpful for any program. Interestingly, this does \textit{not} mean that only left-wing voters oppose cutting aid while an international wealth tax would be vote-determining for right-wing voters. %(as non-voters or right-wing voters may be tempted by left-wing programs and vice versa). TODO? put back?
Indeed, the results by vote show that the tax has a negative (though non-significant) effect among right and far right voters, while cutting aid has a significant effect of $-$2.5~p.p. on \textit{Center-right or Right} voters (Figure \ref{fig:conjoint_vote}), 


\subsection{Testing warm glow}\label{subsec:warm_glow}

Some people might claim they support a policy of global redistribution just to ease their conscience. If support were mainly due to such a psychological mechanism, called \textit{warm glow}, it might
dissipate when the prospect of the policy materializes or if the policy can be replaced by a substitute with the same moral appeal.

\paragraph{Moral substitute.}

Following \cite{nunes_identifying_2003}, warm glow would be revealed if support for the GCS were reduced after respondents are offered the possibility to express generosity towards the cause of climate change. To test this hypothesis, right before the GCS page, I assign a random subset of the respondents to a donation lottery, while the control group faces no question.\footnote{More precisely, right before the GCS question, the sample is split into three branches: the \textit{Donation} lottery, the \textit{NCS} question, and the control group. The NCS treatment is excluded from this analysis as it is unrelated to this experiment (it was created to prevent the NCS question from influencing answers on the GCS).} 
In the \textit{Donation} branch, respondents have to decide how much they would donate to the reforestation NGO \textit{Just One Tree}, should they win the question's \$100 lottery. 
A lower support of the GCS in the treated group would be evidence of warm glow, as it would indicate that the support (at least partially) derives from a moral satisfaction at having recently supported a just cause. 

% # 7. warm_glow: effect of info + display donation vs. control (per country + global)

  \includegraphics[height=.36\textheight]{../figures/country_comparison/share_solidarity_supported_by_info_solidarity.pdf}
\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

On the contrary, support for the GCS is 3.5~p.p. higher in the \textit{Donation} branch compared to the control group, and the coefficient is positive in every country, though often not significant (Figure \ref{fig:warm_glow_substitute}). While it remains unclear why the effect is positive,\footnote{Perhaps the \textit{Donation} question triggers thoughts favorable to the GCS, such as the realization that individual actions like donations are ill-suited to address climate change so that we need a global policy, even if imperfect.} 
the results show no evidence of warm glow.

\paragraph{Realism treatment.}

To test whether some people express support for global redistribution only for as long as its implementation seems unlikely, I randomly treat half of respondents with information about ongoing negotiations on globally redistributive policies. Among other things, treated respondents are informed that the International Maritime Organization recently adopted a levy on maritime carbon emissions that should partly finance LICs; that the G20 considered the introduction of a global tax on billionaires; that the UN General Assembly recently agreed on the principle of expanding the UN Security Council to new members; and that the UN Secretary General supports reforms to the financial system that would drive resources towards sustainable development. 
Then, respondents are asked ``how likely [it is] that international policies involving significant transfers from HICs to LICs will be introduced in the next 15 years'', right before testing their support for ten plausible global policies, described in Section \ref{subsec:debated}. Here, warm glow would be revealed if the information treatment increased the belief that global redistribution is likely but decreased the support for global policies. %(as respondents would fear that such policies may materialize).

Informed respondents are 8~p.p. more likely to believe that global redistribution is likely (with only 35\% believing so in the control group, cf. Table \ref{tab:iv}). With an F-Statistic of 72, this highly significant effect makes for a strong first stage in an instrumental variable (IV) strategy to estimate the effect of believing that global redistribution is likely on the share of global policies supported. As shown in Table \ref{tab:iv}, the Local Average Treatment Effect estimated by IV is 15~p.p., indicating that believing that global redistribution is likely causally \textit{increases} the share policies supported. This effect is consistent with the non-causal effect estimated by OLS at 15~p.p., and with the direct effect of the treatment on the share of policies supported, estimated at 1~p.p. with a \textit{p}-value of 0.06 (Figure \ref{fig:warm_glow_realism}). % TODO wording p-value

  \caption[Effect on support for global redistribution of believing that it is likely]{Effect on support for global redistribution of believing that it is likely.}\label{tab:iv} 
  \makebox[\textwidth][c]{\input{../tables/iv.tex}}
\end{table}

Again, the effects go in the opposition direction to warm glow. In this case, increased support may stem from enhanced credibility of policies that are known to be discussed in international organizations. 
Overall, the results of these two experiments provide no evidence that support for global redistribution is affected by warm glow. On the contrary, they suggest that support is sincere and robust to the prospect of implementation or to the possibility of a moral substitute.


\section{Breadth of international policies accepted\label{sec:breadth}}

Knowing that some internationally redistributive policies are sincerely supported and may be vote-determining, I now study the breadth of international policies that may be accepted. In this Section, I analyze in turn the support for global policies currently debated in the international community, for more radical proposals, broader willingness to defend global solidarity, the preferred channels to transfer resources to LICs, and a custom redistribution task that aims to reveal the preferred extent of international transfers. 
% - People ready to sustainability and radical global redistr (for duty, not reparations)
% - People favor social protection to unconditional transfers

\subsection{Support for currently debated global policies}\label{subsec:debated}

\paragraph{Plausible global policies.}

Figure \ref{fig:solidarity_support_share} reveals the relative support for plausible global policies, % TODO: links to these proposals/negotiations
% TODO RU security council
i.e. the share of \textit{Somewhat} or \textit{Strong support} among non-\textit{Indifferent} answers. Almost each policy garners relative majority support in each country. The only exceptions is the support of Japanese for a globally redistributive tax on carbon emissions from aviation, at 46\%. % TODO RU profit tax?
This proposal is the one with the most salient cost, which a 30\% increase in the price of flights; it is the least support in every country except for Russia. The most supported policies, with above 70\% of relative support in every country, are the 2\% minimum tax on billionaires' wealth proposed by \cite{zucman_blueprint_2024} and the expansion of low-interest rates sustainable investments in LICs \citep{bridgetown_initiative_bridgetown_2025}.

    }\label{fig:solidarity_support_share}
    \makebox[\textwidth][c]{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/country_comparison/solidarity_support_share.pdf}} 
\end{figure}

% The share of plausible policies supported ranges from 38\% in Japan to 66\% in Saudia Arabia and 65\% in Italy. Conversely, the share of policies opposed is highest in Switzerland (29\%), Poland %(23\%) 
% and the U.S. (23\%). The other questions exhibit a similar ranking of countries. 
On average, respondents support 51\% of the plausible policies and oppose 20\% of them, meaning that they support +31~p.p. more policies than they oppose. The most supportive countries, in terms of this average mean difference between support and opposition, are Saudia Arabia (+50~p.p.), Italy (+49) and Spain (+39) while the least supportive are Japan (+20), Switzerland (+24), Poland and the U.S. (+25). 
We may wonder why the countries leading in support are the Saudi kingdom and right-wing-dominated Italy. Decomposing the support by political leaning and other selected sociodemographics, Figures \ref{fig:main_radical_redistr_pol} and \ref{fig:solidarity_support_pol_share} shed some light on this question. In Saudi Arabia, half of the adult population is immigrant. However, foreign workers do not drive the results, as Saudi citizens have indistinguable attitudes from non-Saudis.\footnote{Therefore, temptative explanations may rather come from the Saudi society: 
while Saudis benefit from a generous welfare State, the Islamic principle of \textit{Zakat} (almsgiving) might further foster a culture of generosity.} 
As for Italy is both the country with the lowest gap in support between left-wing and far right voters (together with Japan, at 33~p.p.), and the highest support among left-wing voters.\footnote{While the former point may be linked to the vision of Italy's far right leader of an Africa-Italy partnership (trading off foreign aid with cooperation on fighting immigration), the Italian population might also be influenced by messages in favor of global solidarity from the Vatican.} 

\paragraph{Climate finance goal.}

Climate finance is the financing of climate action from developed countries in developing countries. In 2024, countries agreed on a ``New Collective Quantified Goal'' (NCQG) of climate finance at \$300~billion per year by 2035, tripling the previous goal. However, while developing countries such as India called for \$600~billion in grants (or grant-equivalent funding), the NCQG does not specify which share should be provided as grants, and the current goal is currently met with only \$26~billion in grants \citep{oecd_climate_2024} (and the rest in loans). 

I test the preferred amount for the NCQG using two random variants. Both variants inform respondents of the current situation and agreed goal, and express amounts both in absolute terms and in proportion of developed countries' GDP. The \textit{Short} variant uses qualitative, textual answers, with a middle-point at \$100~billion (namely, ``Meet the newly agreed goal by tripling grants and loans (\$100 billion in grants, or 0.15\% of GDP).''). The \textit{Long} variant provides more detailed explanations in the question text and then uses numerical answers, with a middle-point at \$300~billion. 

In both variants, the median preferred NCQG is \$100~billion, and 19\% of respondents choose an amount of \$600~billion or larger. That differently framed variants yield consistent results suggests that the question was well understood, despite its length. 
The median choice of a climate finance quantum in line with the internationally agreed NCQG may be interpreted in two distinct ways. Either diplomats of HICs currently defend the median generosity 
%sentiment 
of their people, or respondents' attitudes are anchored in existing agreements (or in their governments' stance). The results presented below are more in line with the latter interpretation, as they reveal majority acceptance for much larger international transfers.


\subsection{Support for radical proposals, political action, and broad values}\label{subsec:radical}

In the last part of the questionnaire, I ask diverse questions to understand the range of policies, actions or values that people may accept regarding global solidarity (Figure \ref{fig:radical_redistr_share}).

\paragraph{Sustainable future vs. status quo.}

Respondents are asked which scenario they would prefer for the next twenty years: a sustainable future or the status quo (note that scenarios were not called that way in the questionnaire, and instead randomly named \textit{A} or \textit{B}). In the sustainable scenario, most countries cooperate to tax millionaires and meet the +2\textdegree{}C target, through an electrification of cars and the doubling of prices of heating fuel or gas, air travel, and beef. Although overall purchasing power is preserved (through a reduction in sales tax), people change their habits (e.g. flying and eating meat is cut by half). In the status quo, no policy is implemented, people maintain their lifestyles, and global warming reaches +3\textdegree{}C by 2100, causing more severe disasters. 

Overall, 68\% prefers the sustainable future over the status quo.

\paragraph{Global income redistribution.}

I test the support for a global tax on top incomes to finance poverty reduction in LICs, with the tax targeting either the global top~1\% or top~3\%, depending on a random assignment. While the top~1\% variant describes an additional 15\% tax on income in excess of \$120,000 per year (at Purchasing Power Parity), the top~3\% one features additional rates of 15\%, 30\%, and 45\% above \$80,000, \$120,000, and \$1~million, respectively. Each tax is calibrated to finance the poverty gap, with poverty defined using a threshold of \$250 per month in the top~1\% variant and \$400 per month in the top~3\% one. These taxes entail international transfer of 2\% and 5\% of the world GDP, respectively. % TODO fn method
Using two numerical examples, the question explains to the respondents how the tax would affect taxpayers' income. It also states the share of affected taxpayers in the world and in their country, as well as the share of their country's GDP that would be transferred. For example, in the U.S., the top~1\% tax would affect the top 8\% and transfer 3\% of GDP, while the top~3\% tax would affect the top 18\% and transfer 8\% of GDP. These figures are about half as low in Japan and Germany, and about four times lower in France and Spain. % TODO! support among affected

Overall, 56\% (resp. 50\%) of the respondents support the top~1\% (resp. top~3\%) tax, and 25\% (resp. 28\%) oppose it. There relative majority support for the policy in every case except for Switzerland for the top~3\% tax (in which 18\% case of Swiss people would be affected).

\paragraph{Global convergence.}

A simple question captures the acceptance for global solidarity: ``Should governments actively cooperate to have all countries converge in terms of GDP per capita by the end of the century?'' Overall, 61\% answer \textit{Yes} and 25\% \textit{No}, with the lowest relative agreement (i.e. excluding people not responding%choosing not to answer
) in the U.S., at 56\%.

\paragraph{Willingness to act.}

Two questions ask the respondents how they would react to a ``worldwide movement in favor of a global program to tackle climate change, implement taxes on millionaires and fund poverty reduction in [LICs]''. 

% TODO: to analyze Saudi anomaly: correlation between optimism / well-being and support
% TODO: correlation between growth and support
% TODO compare this to Cappelen et al
In a multiple choice question (that was censored in Russia), 29\% state they could be involved the movement by either attending a demonstration (19\%), going on strike (7\%) or donating \$100 to a strike fund (10\%), and this share rises to 68\% once counting the 52\% of the respondents who ``could sign a petition and spread ideas'' for the movement (Figure \ref{fig:global_movement}). Taken at face value, these results would mean that a successful global solidarity movement could collect up to \$10~billion and gather demonstrations among the largest in history, matching Earth Day mobilizations.\footnote{On April 22, 1970, 20 million US-Americans (10\% of the population) demonstrated for the environment. Since then, Earth Day events regularly mobilize hundreds of million people worldwide.} 

Asked whether they would be more or less likely to vote for the political party they feel closest to if it were part of such a movement, 36\% of the respondents state they would be more likely \textit{versus} 17\% less likely (Figure \ref{fig:vote_intl_coalition}). Among the 5\% of respondents who did not vote in the last election and feel closest to a left-wing party, the share more likely to vote in that case increases to 46\% (\textit{versus} 10\% who are less likely). 

% TODO 584 millionaires

\paragraph{Reasons for helping LICs.}

In a multiple choice question, I ask respondents which reasons for HICs supporting LICs they agree with, among arguments involving \textit{duty}, \textit{long-term interest}, or \textit{historical responsibility}. With 54\%, the reason most chosen in every country (except for France) is \textit{duty}, namely ``Helping countries in need is the right thing to do'' (Figure \ref{fig:why_hic_help_lic}). Besides, 38\% select \textit{interest} and 24\% \textit{responsibility}, with only 17\% disagreeing with every reason.

\paragraph{Reparations.}

In former colonial or slave States,\footnote{I did not ask this question in Japan or Russia, because these countries' historiography do not present their past as colonial but as a larger ``empire''.} 
I ask respondents whether they would support ``reparations for colonization and slavery to former colonies and descendants of slaves'', specifying the reparations ``could take the form of funding education and facilitating technology transfers''. Consistently with the general disagreement that HICs have a \textit{historical} responsibility to support LICs, only a minority of 35\% of respondents support reparations (except in Italy where 56\% do), while 42\% oppose them. This suggests that framing global solidarity as a decolonial struggle might be counterproductive.

\paragraph{Agreement that own taxes should solve global problems.}

% To crosscheck the findings and analyze the extent to which they could be affected by time, framing, or sampling, I reproduced a question asked in a previous study, the ``Global Solidarity Report'' \citep{global_nation_global_2023}. 
Overall, 41\% agree and 28\% disagree that ``[Their] taxes should go towards solving global problem''. With 59\% relative agreement, there is a relative majority in favor of one's own taxes financing global solidarity, though a lower one than for specific proposals that would make the richest contribute.\footnote{This confirms that the willingness to pay for global solidarity, even through taxes, does not equate to support for global redistribution proposals. %Mmeasure the same disposition as the support for global redistribution proposals. 
} 
As explained in Section \ref{sec:data} and shown in Appendix \ref{app:comparison}, the present results replicate well the ``Global Solidarity Report'' that first asked this question \citep{global_nation_global_2023}

% \paragraph{Comparison with existing surveys}

% To crosscheck the findings and analyze the extent to which they could be affected by time, framing, or sampling, I reproduced a question asked in a previous study, the ``Global Solidarity Report'' \citep{global_nation_global_2023}. Overall, 41\% agree and 28\% disagree that ``[Their] taxes should go towards solving global problem''. 
% The results replicate well the earlier study, as relative agreement, at 59\%, is just 3~p.p. higher in the present survey, and the cross-country correlation is .70 (see Figure \ref{fig:comparison} in Appendix \ref{app:comparison}). 

% Furthermore, although the question on the billionaire tax is not worded exactly as in \cite{cappelen_majority_2025}, the results are also very consistent, with an overall absolute support 4~p.p. lower in the present survey and a cross-country correlation of .86.

Asked ``Which group of people do you advocate for when you vote?'',\footnote{In Russia and Saudi Arabia, the question was asked differently. It read: ``Which group do you advocate for?

Universalists are fewer in Japan (30\%) and the U.S. (43\%) but they represent a  majority in Europe (50\%), Russia and Saudi Arabia (57\%), as shown in Figures \ref{fig:group_defended} and \ref{fig:group_defended_all}.

\subsection{Preferred channels to transfer resources to LICs}\label{subsec:transfer_how}

Asked to evaluate the ways to transfer resources to reduce poverty in LICs on a 4-Likert scale, the most preferred option in every country is ``Cash transfers to parents (child allowances), to the disabled and to the elderly'', with 14\% selecting it as the \textit{Best way} overall, and 46\% as a \textit{Right} or \textit{Best way} (Figures \ref{fig:transfer_how}, \ref{fig:transfer_how_above_one}-\ref{fig:transfer_how_negative}). ``Unconditional transfers to the national government'' is the only option seen as a \textit{Wrong way} by the majority, but this share falls from 54\% down to 22\% (and becomes the third most supported option out of seven) when ``transfers to the national government [are] conditioned on the use of funds for poverty reduction programs''. Interestingly, ``Unconditional cash transfers to each household'' are controversial, as they are the second most chosen \textit{Best way} but 36\% view them as a \textit{Wrong way}. Conversely, ``Transfers to public development aid agencies which then finance suitable projects'' is uncontroversial, as only 15\% find it a \textit{Wrong way} \textit{versus} 40\% a \textit{Right} or \textit{Best way}.

\subsection{Custom global income redistribution}\label{subsec:custom_redistr}

The last task of the questionnaire allowed respondents to play with the shape of the global income distribution. The question text includes the following instructions: 
\begin{quote}``Below you will find a graph of the world distribution of after-tax income and three sliders that vary it. The current distribution is in red, and your custom one is in green. The first two sliders control the proportion of winners and the proportion of losers, among all humans. The third slider controls the degree of redistribution from the richest to the poorest. % TODO say whether it's in PPP
If you do not want new policies to reduce global inequality, you can set the third slider to zero.''\end{quote} 
The interactive question is available on \href{https://bit.ly/custom_redistr}{bit.ly/custom\_redistr} and the algorithm to translate sliders' positions into a redistribution is described in Appendix \ref{app:algo}. %and a video explainer on TODO.
Figure \ref{fig:custom_redistr_question} displays what respondents see below the instructions, including the interactive graph and a table summarizing how their custom redistribution would affect five example income levels (including their own, asked right before). To dampen a potential anchoring at sliders' initial positions,%
\footnote{To test for anchoring, I regress responses on the sliders' initial position. %The initial positions have a significant anchoring effect on the responses. %Relative to the other variant's %difference between the two variants' 
% initial positions, a given variant brings the responses closer to its position by 
The anchoring effect, defined as the effect size relative to the difference between the two variants' initial positions, is always significant, at 40\% for the share of winners, 55\% for the share of losers, and 42\% for the degree of redistribution. While anchoring plays a role, the responses converge to a middle point between the two anchors, indicating that the anchors themselves may have been defined by the surveyor (myself) drifting away (in opposite directions) from a shared preference. % collective, common taste or natural focal point. 
} 
the sliders have two random initial positions: %  (yielding similar rich-to-poor transfers of 4.3\% to 4.6\% of the world GDP)
either %the \textit{diffuse} redistribution with 
60\% of winners, 20\% of losers, and a degree of redistribution of 2 out of 10 (as in Figure \ref{fig:custom_redistr_question}); or %the \textit{concentrated} one with 
40\%, 10\%, and 7/10, respectively. 
As the task is difficult to understand (and not so handy %to handle 
on phone screens), respondents are instructed that they can skip it.

\end{figure}

Overall, 56\% are satisfied with their custom redistribution and 43\% skip it. 
% Furthermore, 35\% of the respondents did not move the sliders from their original position, and while 39\% of them still state that they are satisfied with the redistribution, I exclude them from the main analysis, conducted over the 40\% of ``conforming'' % responsive, admitted, 
% respondents who touched the sliders and are satisfied with their custom redistribution. 
While the non-response rate may seem high, it is relatively spread out over the population. Indeed, the share of satisfied respondents is 52\% for non-voters, 54\% for center-right or right-wing voters, 57\% for far right voters and 61\% for left-wing voters; while it ranges from 49\% for people without a %secondary education (i.e. 
high-school diploma to 57\% for those with a post-secondary diploma.

The limited heterogeneity in response rates across crucial sociodemographics suggests that the task enabled motivated respondents to make an informed choice regarding their preferred redistribution with little sacrifice in terms of sample representativeness.

% \paragraph{Anchoring}
% Furthermore, the average responses are similar between satisfied and all respondents: between these groups, the share of winners and the degree of redistribution differ by at most 2\%, and the share of losers by at most 10\%. The similarity in results between satisfied respondents who moved the sliders and those who did not means that the average custom responses are similar to the average between the two possible sliders' initial positions. Two factors may explain this similarity. First, the responses might have been anchored at sliders' initial positions. Second, both the respondents and the surveyor (myself) might have a similar view of what a reasonable redistribution looks like. To test for anchoring, I regress responses on the sliders' initial position. The initial positions have a significant anchoring effect on the responses. %Relative to the other variant's %difference between the two variants'

% To sum up, while this task enables respondents to make an informed choice regarding their preferred redistribution, it remains an imperfect method, and more appropriate ways to reveal citizens' preferred redistribution may be proposed. % TODO: change this paragraph

% With these caveats in mind, 
Figure \ref{fig:custom_redistr_median} shows the median preferred redistribution among satisfied respondents, i.e. the curve obtained by setting the sliders at their median preferred values: 49\% of winners, 18\% of losers, and a degree of redistribution of 5/10, resulting in a transfer from rich-to-poor at 5.4\% of world income and in a minimum income of \$287 per month. 
Interestingly, 48\% choose to lose from their custom redistribution while only 9\% choose to win, the median satisfied respondent choosing parameters such that they neither win nor lose. Besides, 10\% of satisfied respondents choose the status quo, preserving the current income distribution. 
Finally, Figure \ref{fig:custom_redistr_mean} presents the average preferred redistribution among conforming respondents (i.e. the curve obtained by pointwise-averaging custom curves). % TODO use mean_custom_redistr_stats: mean transfer by variant
% TODO distribution of min_income and transfer: custom_redistr_transfer_ceiling custom_redistr_income_min_ceiling
% TODO!? mention touched? => in the appendix
The average preferred redistribution transfers 5.4\% of world income % TODO: harmonize: world income or world GDP?
from the top 27\% to the bottom 73\%, and entails a minimum income of \$247 per month.  % TODO by country
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:tax_radical_redistr}, at the top of the distribution, the average preferred redistribution can be obtained from a 7\% marginal income tax rate above \$25,000 and a 16\% rate above \$40,000 per year (at Purchasing Power Parity). 

\cite{fabre_french_2022} applied the same method to uncover French preferences regarding national income redistribution, and tested the support for the median and average % 42% losers in French average
preferred redistributions on a separate sample. Excluding the 22\% to 24\% of people not responding, the 51\% supported the average redistribution and 67\% the median one.\footnote{\cite{fabre_french_2022} also tested a redistribution obtained from median parameters and a 5\% lower GDP to account for adverse behavioral responses: it was supported by 62\% of French respondents.} 
While one cannot be sure that these results would replicate in the context of a global redistribution, they suggest that the average or median redistributions described above might be accepted by a majority.

% The paper utilizes two sets of surveys: the \textit{global} survey and the \textit{Western} surveys. The \textit{global} surveys consist of two U.S. surveys, \textit{US1} and \textit{US2}, and one European survey, \textit{Eu}. The \textit{global} survey was conducted from March 2021 to March 2022 on 40,680 respondents from 20 countries (with 1,465 to 2,488 respondents per country). \textit{US1} collected responses from 3,000 respondents between January and March 2023, while \textit{US2} gathered data from 2,000 respondents between March and April 2023. \textit{Eu} included 3,000 respondents and was conducted from February to March 2023. We used the survey companies \emph{Dynata} and \emph{Bilendi}. To ensure representative samples, we employed stratified quotas based on gender, age (5 brackets), income (4), region (4), education level (3), and ethnicity (3) for the U.S. We also incorporated survey weights throughout the analysis to account for any remaining imbalances. These weights were constructed using the quota variables as well as the degree of urbanization, and trimmed between 0.25 and 4. Stratified quotas followed by reweighting is the usual method to reduce selection bias from opt-in online panels, when better sampling methods (such as compulsory participation of random dwellings) are unavailable.\cite{scherpenzeel_how_2010} By applying weights, the results are fully representative of the respective countries along the above mentioned dimensions. %. 
% Appendix \ref{app:balance} shows that the treatment branches are balanced. Appendix \ref{app:placebo} runs placebo tests of the effects of each treatment on unrelated outcomes. We do not find effects of earlier treatments on unrelated outcomes arriving later in the survey. Appendix \ref{app:extended} shows that our results are unchanged when including inattentive respondents.
