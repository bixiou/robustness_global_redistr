\section{Introduction}% NCCcomment

Questions that do not prime global solidarity show that this topic is not a salient concern for most people, which may explain why global redistribution proposals receives little attention in public debate, despite widespread acceptance.

% Conjoint: Example use: political candidates (e.g., Teele, Kalla, and Rosenbluth, 2018), immigrants (e.g., Hainmueller and Hopkins, 2015), and public policies (e.g., Ballard-Rosa, Martin, and Scheve, 2017), Hainmueller, Hopkins, and Yamamoto, 2014).
% Fields: Mondon corroborates (using Eurobarometer) than Immigration was the top concern in the UK over 2009-2019 but only #14 concern for "you, personally" (with cost of living being #1) 

\section{Data and design\label{sec:data}}

\paragraph{Samples.}
I conducted an original survey on 12,000 respondents representative of the adult population in eleven high-income countries (see Figure \ref{fig:country_coverage}). The countries have been chosen to span the diversity of high-income countries and the sample sizes to be commensurate to these countries' population sizes.\footnote{The sample sizes are as follows: U.S.: 3,000; Japan: 2,000; Russia: 1,000; Saudi Arabia: 1,000; Europe: 5,000, split in proportion to the countries' adult population size (except for Switzerland), that is France: 798; Germany: 1,048; Italy: 756; Spain: 603; Poland: 500; Switzerland: 469.} 
The survey was fielded online in 2025 using the companies \textit{Yandex} (for Russia), \textit{Kantar} (for Saudi Arabia), and \textit{Bilendi} (for the other countries).\footnote{For all countries but Russia, responses were collected between April 15 and July 3, 2025. For Russia, responses were collected between September 19 and TODO, 2025. Each complete response is rewarded around \euro{}3 in gift points.} 

In Russia, the questionnaire was curtailed as I could not ask the same questionnaire as in the other countries, for two reasons. First, I could not use the platform \textit{Qualtrics}, which prevented me from asking some question formats (such as constant sum scales) or from embedding Javascript (used to design an interactive question). Second, I had to cut or reword some questions due to preventive censorship by the survey company. In the other countries, the questionnaires are almost identical, though the figures in questions are adapted to the country context (e.g. when informing about the cost of the Global Climate Scheme to the average person of the country). Appendix \ref{app:specificities} lists the specificities of the questionnaire in each country.

    \makebox[\textwidth][c]{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/maps_participation/country_coverage_curtailed.png}} 
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Representativeness.}
The samples are stratified to be representative of the country's adult population along the following quota variables (with some exceptions\footnote{In the U.S., I also use race (4 categories) as a quota variable. In Saudi Arabia, I do not use urbanicity, but I use citizenship (Saudi vs. non-Saudi). In Russia, I do not use region nor urbanicity.}): gender, age (5 brackets), income (4), diploma (3), region (2 to 5), and urbanicity (2 to 3). Tables \ref{tab:representativeness_0}-\ref{tab:representativeness_3} in Appendix \ref{app:representativeness} show that our samples match the actual population frequencies along these dimensions, except for Saudi Arabia (where non-Saudis and non-high-school-educated people are underrepresented) and Russia (where TODO). All our results are reweighted to be fully representative of the population along our quotas (with weights trimmed between 0.25 and 4). Results aggregated at the global or European levels weigh each country in proportion to its adult population size. 

Appendix Figure \ref{fig:lmg} shows that 11\% to 17\% of the variance of our main attitudinal outcomes is explained by sociodemographic variables, and this share falls below 5\% after accounting for country and vote. In other words, even though variables such as age or diploma are sometimes significantly correlated with attitudes (see Tables \ref{tab:determinant}-\ref{tab:determinants_custom_redistr}), difference in average acceptance of a policy between (say) age groups rarely exceeds a dozen percentage points. 

Appendix \ref{app:pol} shows how our main attitudinal outcomes vary by political leaning. Non-voters exhibit attitudes close to the center of the politicalspectrum. Besides, attitudes are much less polarized in Japan compared to Europe and the U.S. % TODO: has polarization decreased since last paper?
Appendix Figures \ref{fig:vote_pnr_out}-\ref{fig:vote_representativeness} show how our % weighted or not TODO % TODO! US in Figure
samples compare to reality in terms of vote in the last election. While the share of declared non-voters is lower than in reality, votes along the three main political leanings are close to reality. Appendix \ref{app:vote} shows that our main results are robust to reweighting by vote. 

\paragraph{Data quality.} 
The median survey duration is 17 minutes (13 min in Russia). % Following TODO cite Stantcheva
Best practices have been used to ensure top-notch data quality. 
The questionnaire has been worded in a neutral and informative way;\footnote{At the end of the survey, 70\% of the respondents find it politically unbiased (Appendix Figure \ref{fig:survey_biased}).} tested on random people in public spaces to make sure it is correctly understood; translated by professional translators and double-checked by native speakers.

Of all respondents who started the questionnaire, only TODO \% dropped out. TODO respondents were allowed to pursue the survey (as their quotas were not full) and did not drop out.  The final sample is obtained after excluding of this extended sample TODO \% of respondents for suspicion of low quality: \% for failing an attention test and \% for answering the questionnaire in less than 6 min (including \% for both reasons). Appendix \ref{app:attrition} checks for differential attrition and Appendix \ref{app:extended} shows that our main results replicate on the extended sample. 
% TODO: feedback field

Whenever possible, the order of question items is randomized. Appendix \ref{app:order} studies the effect of item order on answers. The item order generally has a significant but small effect (2 to 10~p.p.). The size of the effect help identify questions for which opinions are strongly held (e.g. the preference of a sustainable scenario over the status quo) \textit{versus} weakly held (e.g. the preferred amount of climate finance). % crystallized, well-formed, consolidated, stable, ambivalent

Appendix \ref{app:comparison} compares the answers of two attitudinal questions asked in other surveys: the overall averages differ by 2 to 4~p.p. and their cross-country correlation is high: .70 \citep{global_nation_global_2023} to .86 \citep{cappelen_majority_2025}. 

\paragraph{Incentives.}
The questionnaire includes three incentivized questions, each awarded with a \$100 prize for one randomly drawn winner. First, a comprehension question on the Global Climate Scheme (GCS) checks whether respondents have understood the policy's cost. % TODO: support among those who haven't understood
Second, a donation lottery where respondents choose what part of the prize they would donate to a reforestation NGO, should they win the lottery. Third, a question on the perception of the actual support for the GCS, which rewards a correct guess.

\paragraph{Survey structure.}
While Appendix \ref{app:questionnaire} provides the full questionnaire, Figure \ref{fig:flow} depicts the survey flow with all random branches. The various treatments are all independent and uniformly distributed. Appendix \ref{app:placebo} runs placebo tests to check whether earlier treatments have an effect on unrelated outcomes.

    \caption[Survey flow]{Survey flow.
    }\label{fig:flow}
    \makebox[\textwidth][c]{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/questionnaire/survey_flow.pdf}} 
\end{figure}

After sociodemographic characteristics, the questionnaire starts with broad questions to grasp the prioritization and salience of global solidarity before the respondents can understand the survey's topic. First, open-ended fields on either their main concerns, wants, issues of interest, or perceived injustices. Second, a conjoint experiment where respondents have to select their preferred political program, or abstain. Both programs are random: each policy (or absence of policy) in five policy domains is taken at random from a pool of policies prominent in the country's public debate. Third, respondents are asked to allocate the revenue of a global wealth tax between five (national or global) spending items. 

Then come attitudinal questions on the main policies studied: a \textit{Climate Scheme} at the national, global, or international level; an international wealth tax funding low-income countries; and ten plausible global solidarity policies. These questions include treatments that vary the international coverage of policies or test for warm glow. 

The last part of the questionnaire explores attitudes towards more radical global redistribution scenarios and include more sophisticated questions, such as an interactive task where respondents can choose their preferred custom redistribution of global incomes by manipulating sliders. 

Finally, the survey concludes with a comprehension question, synthetic questions (e.g. on moral circle) and a feedback field.

\paragraph{Pre-registered hypotheses and data availability.}
The project is approved by the CIRED institutional review board (IRB-CIRED-2025-2) and %is approved by IRB at Harvard University (IRB21-0137), and 
was preregistered in the Open Science Foundation registry (\href{https://osf.io/7mzn4}{osf.io/7mzn4}). The study did not deviate from the registration: the questionnaires and the hypotheses tests used are the ones \href{https://osf.io/j5scn}{specified \textit{ex ante}}. All data and code as well as figures of the paper are available on \href{https://github.com/bixiou/robustness_global_redistr}{github.com/bixiou/robustness\_global\_redistr}. 


\section{Salience and prioritization of global solidarity\label{sec:salience}}
% - People view global poverty/ineq as big injustice though not salient concern (e.g. revenue_split)
In this Section, I analyze the salience of global solidarity in undirected open-ended fields; and the prioritization of global programs in a budget allocation task.

\subsection{Top-of-mind considerations}

At the beginning of the survey, respondents are randomly assigned one open-ended question among four: their main concerns, their needs or wishes, an issue important to them but neglected in public debate, or the greatest injustice of all. The questions are deliberately broad and vague to let respondents express their top-of-mind considerations without any priming.

To analyze the answers, I automatically translated each field into English.\footnote{I used \href{https://www.onlinedoctranslator.com/en/translationform}{onlinedoctranslator.com}, which is powered by \textit{Google Translate}.} Then, I used AI and my own reading of a few hundreds answers to identify the most common concepts, from which I selected 27 categories. Then, I classified each answer into one or more of these categories, both manually (Figures \ref{fig:field_manual}-\ref{fig:injustice_field}) and automatically using AI (Figure \ref{fig:field_gpt}). Finally, I manually defined a list of 47 (conjunction of) keywords and used it to automatically classify all answers.\footnote{The list of keywords is given in Appendix TODO.} I report occurrences of the 24 most common categories in Figure \ref{fig:field_keyword}. 

The three different classification methods yield consistent results but differ in accuracy. While the keyword classification allows an exact and reproducible search of concepts, the automatic search is not bound to specific words and captures more matching responses. % Although the manual classification could be less consistent than the AI one (if e.g. the interpretation of the category changes over time or among coders), 
Overall, it seems that the manual classification provides the most accurate results, with a number of matches generally between the two other methods. 
For example, to the \textit{injustice} question, 1.3\% of answers match the keywords for \textit{global inequality}, ChatGPT identifies 8.5\% of answers in this category, \textit{versus} 3.7\% according to my manual coding.\footnote{The keyword matching searches the regular expression ``global poverty|global inequal|hunger|drinking water|starv'', ignoring case. The automatic and manual classification is based on the class definition ``Inequality at the inetrnational level / Hunger or poverty in poor countries''.} 
Indeed, the AI incorrectly classifies answers like ``poverty'' in this category,\footnote{Interestingly, out of the 45 (one-word) answers ``poverty'', ChatGPT coded only 42 of them as \textit{global inequality}, showing the lack of consistency of this classifier.} while the keyword search misses answers like ``inequality among humans''. 
Given this observation, I use the manual classification as the benchmark and the two other methods as robustness checks.

While less accurate than the classifications, wordclouds (Figure \ref{fig:wordcloud}) provide a simple visualization of the most common concepts in each question. By far, the most frequent \textit{concerns} or \textit{wishes} of respondents relate to their purchasing power, with concepts such as ``money'', ``inflation'', or the ``cost of living'' mobilized in 30\% of these fields. Within country, the share of people concerned with money decreases with income: it ranges from 21\% in the top income decile to 36\% in the bottom one. % TODO define e$gdp_pc_ppp and cor money
The next most frequent \textit{concerns} are health (or the healthcare system), far right governments (or related concepts such as ``Trump'' or ``trade tariffs''), and war (either in general or a specific one such as the Gaza war). Most \textit{wishes} are personal, with the next frequent ones related to the health or peace of mind of oneself or one's relatives. Interestingly, almost none of the responses mention social considerations such as love, intimate life, friendships, loneliness, or the desire to have children (with the exception of Saudi Arabia for the latter). Further research is needed to test whether the predominance of materialistic considerations stems from the context (an impersonal survey) or truly reflects people's primary thoughts.

% The paper utilizes two sets of surveys: the \textit{global} survey and the \textit{Western} surveys. The \textit{global} surveys consist of two U.S. surveys, \textit{US1} and \textit{US2}, and one European survey, \textit{Eu}. The \textit{global} survey was conducted from March 2021 to March 2022 on 40,680 respondents from 20 countries (with 1,465 to 2,488 respondents per country). \textit{US1} collected responses from 3,000 respondents between January and March 2023, while \textit{US2} gathered data from 2,000 respondents between March and April 2023. \textit{Eu} included 3,000 respondents and was conducted from February to March 2023. We used the survey companies \emph{Dynata} and \emph{Bilendi}. To ensure representative samples, we employed stratified quotas based on gender, age (5 brackets), income (4), region (4), education level (3), and ethnicity (3) for the U.S. We also incorporated survey weights throughout the analysis to account for any remaining imbalances. These weights were constructed using the quota variables as well as the degree of urbanization, and trimmed between 0.25 and 4. Stratified quotas followed by reweighting is the usual method to reduce selection bias from opt-in online panels, when better sampling methods (such as compulsory participation of random dwellings) are unavailable.\cite{scherpenzeel_how_2010} By applying weights, the results are fully representative of the respective countries along the above mentioned dimensions. %. 
% Appendix \ref{app:balance} shows that the treatment branches are balanced. Appendix \ref{app:placebo} runs placebo tests of the effects of each treatment on unrelated outcomes. We do not find effects of earlier treatments on unrelated outcomes arriving later in the survey. Appendix \ref{app:extended} shows that our results are unchanged when including inattentive respondents.
